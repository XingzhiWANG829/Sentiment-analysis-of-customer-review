I had been wanting a paperwhite but wouldn't buy one when my Fire worked fine.  Then it didn't.  It stopped charging so I bought the paperwhite.  So happy I did!

4,1,"I was hesitant to buy Kindle because it is single purpose, slow at the age of faster multi purpose smartphones and and tablets. I have tried reading books on my computer, smartphone but it didn‚Äôt work for me. I would ger distracted with notifications and other apps.

10,1,"I have a fire and this new paperwhite (well, new when I bought it earlier this year). Unlike the claims Amazon makes, it does not hold the charge for weeks (because I use it a lot), but it does last a lot longer than my fire, and it charges fast--from dead to full power in an hour. I would like charge claims to actually state how many hours a charge lasts on all Kindle products because everyone's reading habits are different. A few things I especially like is that it's easier to delete a book from the home page and the covers that automatically turn it on/off. I'm glad I upgraded, am happy with my paperwhite and would recommend it.",5,2018-10-19,,True,,great product,,
11,1,I love my Kindle paperwhite. I can take it to the pool and sit in the sun and read without glare. I have been reading on the Kindle paperwhite for years.

16,1,"Holy smokes-this thing is awesome!  Here's what you need to know about buying a Kindle:<br />There are 4 kinds:  The expensive one.  Don't buy that one (the battery dies too quickly).  The cheap one.  Don't buy the cheap one, it's not good enough.  This one-it's awesome.  The one above this one-don't buy that one, I forget why.<br /><br />Really important:  Do NOT buy the $30 cover.  Go to Target and buy the very thin cover ($12 or so) that shuts off the Paperweight when you close it.  This cover will let u put the Paperweight in the pocket of your coat or scrubs.  You WANT the thin $12 cover.<br /><br />This part is awesome:  Kindle gives you your own e-mail address!  You can e-mail documents to your e-mail address (ie:  georgewashington@kindle.com) and when you sync they'll be loaded onto your Paperweight!<br /><br />You don't need to buy the charger.  Trust me, you have a charger.  Everyone has a charger.  In another couple of years chargers will be just sitting around everywhere.  Just use any old charger you've got.<br /><br />FREE. BOOKS!  Okay, if you LOVE to read, here's what you can do.  Do a search on Amazon books for 'Books everyone should read'.  Find a book that lists 100 or 200 or 500 of the books everyone should read.  This will be free.  Ya' with me so far?  Get that & download it/open it.  THEN, open up a separate window and in Amazon books, type in the name of the book followed by the word 'free'.  For example, type in 'Tarzan, free', or 'Gulliver's Travels, free', or 'Tom Sawyer, free' and Amazon will give you a list of all the free e-books w/that title!  You get 100's and 100's and 100's and 100's of books FREE!  YIPPEEE!!!<br /><br />The Kindle Paperweight is the one Xmas present everyone should have.  YOU deserve one of these things YES YOU DO!<br /><br />Hot damn the Paperweight is awesome.  One of the best purchases I've ever made.",5,2018-10-05,6.0,True,,I did the research-let me save you a LOT of time and $50:,,
17,1,"I never thought I‚Äôd like reading on anything but an actual book in my hands, but my daughter convinced me to try the Kindle Paperwhite E-reader and I love it.

24,1,This is my 2nd paperwhite and I love it. I like to read in the dark so as not to disturb anyone and the backlight of the kindle is wonderful for night time reading. It is great for anytime also.

33,1,I like the brighter background.  Finding my  new books is difficult.  Which ones are unread are not really marked in an easy way to access them.  My first Kindle put them on a list to select and the archive books were in alpha order by author.  This made it easy to see if I already had the book.  I am going to get a new battery for my old one and go back to using it.,3,2018-05-01,,True,,I am not impressed,,
34,1,Love my kindle! Ive always wanted to start reading again but i always saw it inconvenient to bring a book and i like tiny purses so it never worked. Now i can bring book anywhere i go. Love it,5,2018-05-01,,True,,Love my kindle,,
35,1,Replacing standard Kindle which does not have built in light. Much easier than dealing with add on light source. Perfect for reading in low light. One glaring negative is lack of an operation manual. There is a definite learning curve when switching from the standard Kindle and the differences are not intuitive. Finding books in your library is not the same as with the standard Kindle and is really inconvenient. Again a manual would be very useful.When my new paper white powered up the first time the language changed from English to Japanese which created a huge problem. All the settings instructions also switched to Japanese so any directions for changing back to English were useless unless you read Japanese. I finally found an online posting that walked me through steps to switch back to English. Someone at Amazon needs his or her ass kicked for not providing a solution for this possibility. Very poor support from Amazon in this area.,4,2018-04-30,,True,,Works great when set up in English,,

44,1,I had a Kindle 3rd generation for about 10 years and it quit working so I had to buy a new one. the thing I don't like about the new one is: I prefer the page turning buttons rather than the swiping motion needed to turn the pages on the new one and the thing I like about the new one is that it works great in the dark.,5,2018-09-12,,True,,The light works great in the dark',,

53,1,"Size and paper white part of this are awesome. Two stars because each time I scroll, turn the page or open anything it, it flashes as it is loading. I thought it was damaged because of how often it was occurring until I watched some videos about this device. The videos showed this Kindle doing the same thing while loading any page. It is very distracting. Completely crushed after being super excited. ‚òπÔ∏è<br /><br />If there is a way to turn that off somehow, I would totally keep it.",2,2018-04-15,,True,,Distracting and annoying,,

56,1,The battery isn‚Äôt lasting as long as the one I bought in 2013. Having trouble figuring out what is on the device and the library. Not as easy as my last one for me. Maybe the more I use it I will figure it out currently it is confusing.,4,2018-04-15,,True,,Not as easy as my last one for me,,

I love that prime gives you free books too.",5,2018-04-15,,True,,Very Happy w/ Purchase,,
58,1,"This thing is super cool. Really light weight, feels like I'm reading a book instead of a computer screen, and you don't have to hold pages open. I started to lose some shelf space and this was a great remedy. Plus e-books are naturally cheaper.<br /><br />The downsides I see is:<br />- Forgetting to charge it (but can hold a charge for a week)<br />- Carrying it around in any kind of bag without being worried about breaking it.<br />- Can't share or lend any books.<br /><br />Other than that, really cool gadget.",5,2018-04-14,,True,,Wish I got this a while ago.,,

62,1,It's basically a reader and does all things associated with that very well.  Easy to read in any light and long lasting battery.  Only concern I have run into is that sometimes swiping a finger across the page does not result in a page turn and the operation has to be repeated. No other touch screen issues.,4,2018-10-18,,True,,Good reader but finicky page turning.,,
63,1,"I‚Äôm a late adopter of Kindle. What put me over the edge was having to return a library book just as I was heading out of town.

Each time, engineering tells tech to ask me to do do the same procedures I already did before I even called for help. Tech people repeatedly promise to call after 2-3 days when engineering gets back to them but they don‚Äôt call. Worst of all, they refuse to acknowledge that there clearly is an issue with Kindle batteries. They actually want me to believe that I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs had issues 3 Kindles in a row.

132,1,"I purchased this so my husband & I could read to our son (1yr) in the dark while putting him to bed. The backlighting options are perfect, because a screen that‚Äôs too bright distracts our kiddo to the point he won‚Äôt be able to fall asleep, but with the kindle we‚Äôre able to use a really dim light that goes unnoticed by our boy! We can also adjust the font size which allows us to prop the kindle up on a bookshelf & read hands free (aside from page turning of course).<br /><br />I‚Äôve never been a big reader as I‚Äôm rather slow- sort of the anti speed reader...- and I get distracted easily (guess I know where my son gets it!); however, I have been a voracious reader since getting the kindle!! In the couple months we‚Äôve had it I‚Äôve read over 10 different books (I‚Äôm not sure I read that many during college!). The backlighting allows me to read at night with minimal glow, so my eyes aren‚Äôt tired & if I fall asleep it shuts down and keeps me on the same spot for when I return to it. No more forgetting where I was and having to reread chapters!<br />I love that I can quickly access books for my son as well as my personal reading list. The dictionary feature is perfect- as I don‚Äôt have to leave the page or pull out my phone to figure out the meaning of an unfamiliar word. It holds a charge well, and I can usually go a week & a half before I need to plug it in. It was the perfect companion for my last vacation, and I love that I didn‚Äôt have to lug around a bulky book in my valuable carry on!<br />I‚Äôve also gone ahead with the ‚Äúkindle unlimited‚Äù program, as I was reading quickly enough that the first month was pretty expensive!

149,1,"I wanted a compact and light E reader that combined the basic KIndle with Audible.  During Black Friday weekend I did some investigating.  Amazon had a chart on its website that showed all three Kindles currently available (including this one) and all their features/ specifications.  All three models were shown as  having the Audible feature--it was through Bluetooth and you would need a Bluetooth enabled speaker or headphones to use it.  Even better Amazon had a trade in program that allowed you to trade in your old Kindle, and provided an additional  20% discount.  I traded in my Kindle (which was in great shape as I use the Audible function more than the E reader) which was appraised at $25.  I received my new Kindle today, charged it, registered it, and quickly discovered it did not have the Audible feature.  I found another web page on Amazon with a lengthier description of this product-- there was no mention of the Audible feature.  It appears it is included only on the other 2 newer models.<br /><br />I'm pretty ticked--I hate shopping , but do my research and I just traded in a perfectly good Kindle and spent $70 for basically what I previously owned.  I don't see myself getting my old Kindle back so buyer beware,  Amazon's advertising may not always be accurate--double check what you are buying.<br /><br />UPDATE-- As a last resort I finally found a tech support phone number.  They had the same problem--and concluded the web page was incorrect.  After a lot of discussion about my limited options, I was transferred to a supervisor and we worked out an agreement for me to upgrade to the current generation Kindle.  I am now awaiting my new Kindle.<br /> I appreciate the time and effort on the part of Amazon staff and I initially increased my rating from 1 star to 5 stars.  However, I went and checked the erroneous web page today--it is still online and incorrect.

207,1,"I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars because I really do love the Paperwhite.  I bought one 5 years ago and took it everywhere with me -- until last month I think I left it in a hotel room.  Then for a month waiting for the Amazon Prime day, I went into serious withdraw not having it with me.<br /><br />So this one is a little different from the first one I had, and I'm not totally thrilled with the changes.  Maybe someone out there can help me how to get around them....<br /><br />The big change I don't like is how now when I look at my library - whether on the device or on the cloud - I have to look at little block book cover images.  Why can't I have just a simple text list?  I currently have about 80 or 90 books on my account, and on the old one, that meant I might need to go through 8 or 9 pages before I found what I was looking for.  Now with the little pictures, it only fits 6 books per page.  The only way to cut down that number of pages as your library increases is to create &#34;collection&#34; folders.  Which I admit I may have ended up doing anyway because you also can't rearrange your library in the order you want.  If I'm looking for things from a particular author, I need to go through most pages anyway.<br /><br />Other than that, I love the Paperwhite.  I could never go for the original kindle because I read a lot at night so the back light on the Paperwhite is essential.  So to help make up for the extra cost, I got the one with the advertisements -- which are really just &#34;screen savers&#34; so I don't see what the big deal is about them.  I've actually come across some good suggestions of books I've later enjoyed.  PLUS.....if you only put the device on WiFi  when you are downloading and you keep it in airplane mode the rest of the time, eventually the ads go away and you just get the generic Kindle screen saver.",4,2018-07-21,,True,,I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars,,
208,1,"&#34;4 GB&#34; - well, a lot of it must be system, because I downloaded most of my Kindle library - less than 1500 books - and I'm down to 98 MB. Storage is *cheap* these days, but there's a lot of space that the cloud doesn't cover. One of the things I like about the Kindle line is being able to be untethered from the cloud; that's not the case with this product.<br /><br />I got the Paperwhite to be able to read without all the notifications from social media on the Kindle Fire, and for that it's great. Page turns take a bit of getting used to, as they are vastly different from the Fire. The cutesy page turn looks more like crumbling text, so I turned that 'feature' off. I'll probably look into getting rid of the special offers at some point. It has an experimental browser; I'd prefer more space for books, and no browser. (Of course it has a Kindle store, I'd expect that.) As an e-Reader, it needs some tweaking back towards the e-Reader idea - I already HAVE a 10&#34; Fire if I want browsers and all that.",3,2018-07-21,,True,,"4 GB isn't a lot of space for a bibliophile, especially with system storage space. 8 GB would be much more reasonable.",,

314,1,"I have been reading on an Android tablet. I switched to Kindle because of the memory capacity and the &#34;Paperwhite&#34; feature. I love the &#34;readability&#34; of the paperwhite but, because of my bad eyesight, I enlarge the text. When I try to interact with the Kindle on the home, settings, or any other screen the text is too small, and the black and white pictures too blurry. The advertised &#34;Weeks&#34; of battery life are a complete falsehood as far as my Kindle is concerned. I get, maybe, 4 days until I have to recharge. I read approx. 15- 20 hours a week. I'ts much better than my Acer tablet as far as reading goes, but the rest just kind of sucks. There are much better reading apps for Android..",2,2018-05-17,,True,,"I love the ""readability"" of the paperwhite but",,

329,1,"Super disappointed in my kindle paper white. I've been reading on my Kindle phone app, and using the app on my ipad for years but decided the time had come to get a Kindle. The only thing I really like about it is the paper white screen. It is easy on my eyes and easy to read out of doors. However, I find the user clunky to use. I have trouble finding my own library. I loathe the constant ads for other books, they aren't even targeted to the genres of book I read. And frankly, I'm never buying an ebook for $10. I might pay that for a physical book, but I have something tangible that I could resell, donate, or burn for warmth in a power outage. Ebooks have only the entertainment value, and frankly I could just check them out of the library free.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the kindle.  I can be sitting in my livingroom, hooked up to the wifi and this stupid thing won't sync to my current location and God forbid I should leave my house--if I can even find the sync controls. I can't even find a way to pull up the chapter links so I can at least forward it to a closer location.<br /><br />I can't believe I wasted my money on this when the phone and tablet apps are more technically advanced.",3,2019-01-22,,True,,A big fat step backwards!üòï,,

Likewise, it's much easier to read in bed now since I don't have to have a lamp on.<br /><br />I love that I can highlight a word and get a dictionary pop-up for it.<br /><br />By far the best part has been the ability to use overdrive via my library to rent books and download them directly to my Kindle.<br /><br />The ads are minor nuisance that only show when turning the device on.

363,1,"UPDATED: there were over 62000 reviews for the paper white. Apparently Amazon takes reviews of it's own product very seriously. I received an unsolicited call today from tech support. It was a very productive call and I now have a working Kindle. Thank you Amazon!<br />Rating updated from 1 to 5 for a company that cared so much about it's customer experience. No<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST: I've had two of these. The second one, purchased in March 2016, was relatively unused. Very little total reading time. I had on 3 or 4 occasions let the battery run completely out. A few months ago I charged it up to use it and found the touch screen unresponsive. I rebooted using a 40 second hold on the power button. At the 7 second button hold mark a prompt to power off or reboot showed up on the screen. Of course I could not select it so carried on until the forced reboot took place. Touch screen still didn't work. I do know that the product could connect to wifi and download books I sent to it from my account because in the background of the reboot popup that appears at the 7 second mark, I could see the new books were added - so it seems the software was fine. Finally I called support and they stated there was nothing they could do because it already had the latest software... wait a minute. I never updated the software. Maybe a forced software or firmware update bricked a relatively unused kindle. At the end of the day I was passed the 1 year warranty + the 1 year extension offered by my citibank card. I liked reading on the kindle, but I think if a product bricks itself it's just plain bad. I have an iPad version 1. It still works fine. Slow, but fine. I'm a big fan of Amazon - I have many echos, dots, fire stick, fire cube. I'm not a hater. I'm just very disappointed in this product and its performance.",5,2018-07-30,,True,,UPDATED - Tech support came though,,

It was one of Amazon's policy. They want us to buy new kindle devices. Unless we buy how will they sell their devices?! I did not even use my kindle because of my classes and stuff. Now i am really pissed of by Amazon. I would tell my friends and family not to buy any kindle device. There are lots of other options.

Thank you.<br /><br />I bought this in July 2017, it worked beautifully, until about 3 weeks ago- the whole reason why I went with a kindle paper white and not a tablet was because I wanted a long battery life. Suddenly, the battery will not hold a charge while in use. Idle it will last about 24 hours. But in use.. 6-8 hours. I contacted amazon to see if they could help me, and they want me to test further how fast the battery is draining.. I need to hang up with them charge the device and test it further. And call them again. Thanks for nothing.",5,2018-04-28,2.0,True,,Battery drains quickly after less then a year.,,

I would end up down a Facebook or email rabbit hole while trying to read.  Now I get why a dedicated reader device like a kindle is so popular. I read a lot more now. It's lighter than a tablet. Easier to hold. Truly easier on the eyes. Easily fits in my cargo shorts pocket, or my ""man purse"". I was giving plasma this week and this was much easier to hold one handed than my table. I am convinced. And that's coming from someone who worked for Apple for a decade and swore by an all in one device like an iPad.

It has been a really disappointing experience. In addition to not being able to browse for books like I could on the other one, it is awful to use. It will suddenly jump fifty pages ahead; too many to just back page, but that doesn't matter, because if you try, it will go through the same five or six pages over and over.

After about an hour I booted it up and it automatically installed a software update followed by a reboot. When it restarted it locked up with an error message on the screen. So I held down the power button to reboot it again and ever since it's been stuck in an unrecoverable boot loop (tree image). Holding the power button for 40+ seconds does nothing to stop the loop.

488,1,These are the best E Readers there are in my opinion. They work well in any lighting conditions and the battery life is very good. I will not get into how long it lasts because that is so subjective. It really depends on how much you read. I read everyday for probably minimum 3 hours. The battery lasts me a couple weeks I'd say. It is not the month claimed but that is based on substantially less reading than I do.<br /><br />This is the 3rd one I've had. The first one was in a case which turned it on when the case was opened. I managed to drop it in a pool and watched in slow motion as the I tried to grab it only to knock the cover open. I watched it turn on as went to the bottom of the pool. Not Good. Needless to say it was toast. It might have survived if it hadn't been turning on as it got wet. The 2nd one I had for a year and Amazon offered a Special trade in my Paperwhite for $25 and get 25% off a new at $99. This means a new Paperwhite for $50. Since I use it so much I thought why not. After unsuccessfully trying to buy it I had to call Amazon to find why I couldn't order it. They told me I had to send in my old one on the trade deal then IU would get a link to purchase the new one. I did this but when I go the link back it was for a $120 price. I called Amazon again and I had to speak with a supervisor but they did a work around so that I ended up honoring the deal so I got the new Paperwhite for the special offer. I have to credit the supervisor I spoke with because he went out of his way to figure out how he could get the Kindle for the price they had offered it to me.

However, I might have to send it back for another one because it freezes every now and then upon opening the case (with sleep/wake) cover .no ideas why this is happeming, but I don't want this to be an ongoing problem. It also wont automatically update to the latest firmware 5.9.5. I don't have a computer or laptop so I cannot do it manually. But, after some research I have discovered that it can take a few weeks for an update to happen automatically so the verdict is still out on that. Overall, I am thrilled and very happy with the PW3. I don t need all of the bells and whistles of the other models. This one suits me just perfectly. Easily fits into my small purse, or pocket. Lightweight, even in the case I purchased (Fintie book style folio case with sleep/wake magnetic cover) still light enough to hold for hours with one hand. It's my first e reader and after deciding between the PW3 & Voyage, I made the right choice.

630,1,"but I don't.<br />This Kindle replaced a 2nd generation Kindle which had the original battery and still held a charge that lasted weeks and weeks. I could not use the web browser but could still buy books. From reading reviews that was something done on Amazon's end as I did have all available updates.  So I decided I would trade it in and Amazon offered a 25% discount on a new one.<br />I decided on a Paperwhite. with special offers. I thought the offers would be distracting but they really were not. The Kindle however....it's not WHITE. The pages look gray just like my old Kindle. Yes, putting the light on alleviates that but I am not a fan of the lights. There is a definite shadowing at the bottom of the page unless the light is turned almost all the way up.<br />I bought a magnetic close cover and that was supposed to put it in sleep mode when you close the cover. I imagine it does as when I open it, it is in standby and has to be swiped to open.<br />And the battery? After the first charge it worked for 2 weeks. I charged it again and it showed a full charge but after reading for only an hour or so, it was quickly depleted to about 25% charge remaining. I had wifi off and the light was on a low (10) level. Could I have a defective battery? Perhaps. But at this point, I'm not loving it and I'm just going to return it.<br />I wish I had kept my 2nd generation.

637,1,"In some ways the Paperwhite makes me miss my Kindle Keyboard ‚Äî most particularly when I want to use the Text to Speech (TTS) function and then remember that it doesn‚Äôt exist on this device. I tend to enjoy reading highly technical books, but if I‚Äôm relaxing and paging through a bestseller or something not too serious I like having the option to turn on TTS. I used to use TTS on the Keyboard if I was working with my hands or doing some tidying up. It was also nice having some of my favourite classical music on my Kindle Keyboard to play while reading if I was in a noisy place. Now the headphone jack is completely gone - and so is TTS. This is really disappointing and why I can‚Äôt give the device more than three stars.<br /><br />To be fair, the Paperwhite is certainly a more elegant looking device than the Kindle Keyboard (plus the text appears sharper and pages turn more quickly), but it‚Äôs less open and accessible than earlier Kindles.<br /><br />I‚Äôm not holding my breath waiting for Amazon to bring back the headphone jack and TTS in future versions of the Kindle, since I‚Äôm sure the company is looking to sell more audiobooks after its acquisition of Audible. However, I just don‚Äôt enjoy using the Paperwhite as much I enjoyed using the Kindle Keyboard. This device feels less revolutionary, less concerned with actual users, and entirely too focused on killing a wonderful convenience (and accessibility feature!) for the sake of selling a few more audiobooks.<br /><br />I guess you don‚Äôt really know what you have until it‚Äôs gone.

683,1,"Received this device beginning of June 2018 and took it on a trip to Singapore and Thailand. While reading outside, noticed that the device's coating started to bubble and peel at the places where my fingers touched it.  I tried to make do with it but after returning home and spending other days outside reading, I got tired of getting little flakes of black on me as I read so I called Amazon. They replaced the device with a certified refurbished device at the end of August 2018. I took it on another trip, where I was reading outside, and the second device started to bubble and peel in the areas where my fingers touched it just like the first did.<br /><br />Contacted Amazon and they stated that shouldn't happen and told me to send it back (they sent me a label). They also gave me a free case to use with the next (third?) device I would receive in the hopes that would prevent the bubbling and peeling a third time.<br /><br />I shipped the second device back and received the case. Five days later, I received an email from Amazon saying they reloaded the software on my second peeling device, it works and they were sending it back to me. But that was NEVER the problem. The device always worked it just flaked and peeled.<br /><br />I spent an hour on the phone with them getting the run-around trying to find someone who would send me another device as the first person I spoke to said they would. I'm still waiting...<br /><br />UPDATE: After hanging up on the first employee who refused to transfer me to a supervisor (or anyone else for that matter), I called back and after getting the same runaround (they wanted me to return the second device, they were shipping back to me to them for a second time before they would do anything but they actually still had it in their possession!) I finally got a hold of  a ""supervisor"". After explaining the issue again (apparently good notes were not maintained on my file), he finally agreed to refund me the purchase price of the original device.<br /><br />I've since ordered the new model that will be released on 11/7/2018 - hopefully, there will be no issues.<br /><br />Furthermore, another associate from Amazon reached out to me the next day, after seeing this review to talk to me about my experience. Honestly, the flaking was annoying but what really soured me was the complete lack of consistency and ability to do anything on the part of most of the customer service people to whom I spoke to rectify the issue short of me returning the device a third time when it was still in their possession.<br /><br />I'm glad customer service reached out and I hope they do something to either empower their employees to help customers or at the very least train them to transfer calls to their supervisors instead of saying that's not possible over and over again.",1,2018-10-29,,True,,"Coating on Device Peels Off - If I could rate it lower than 1 star, I would",,

I am toally happy with it, but I tend to buy more books since I have one, whiich could be a negative. :)<br /><br />I can only think of a couple of things I would improve. One, you can't turn on an inverse image (black background, white letters) for night viewing when trying not to disturb your spouse. But you can turn the background light down low enough that it's not really an issue, certainly a lot less than if a lamp is on. But still, a black background would be nice. The second is that the menu is a bit cumbersome until you get used to it. Things aren't where you might expect them to be. And one more ... I wish there was a feature to continuously show the title of the book at the top, like a regular paper book does. I sometimes forget the title of the book that I'm reading, and that feature would be very helpful.

829,1,I really like how the back lighting changes by itself so you can be reading in bright sunlight and walk into darkened room (or even closet as I experimented with) and still see what you're reading without having to adjust anything. At first I didn't realize how easy it was to turn pages but just a light tap on the screen is all it takes so you can do it one handed. And the Paperwhite is much lighter than a book. Plus Kindle books are cheaper than paper and don't waste paper.

The first Kindle to arrive had the bad light shadows noted in other reviews and one tiny light hole at the bottom. Amazon replace it with a REFURBISHED one - which had the same, if not worse, shadow problem at the bottom of the screen. First I was told this is normal, then I was told that it was out of warranty. A whole TWO days old. Really? CS changed their mind about that one and I just returned it. They credited me so that I could repurchase at the same sale price. Hmmmmm... What are the odds that my third one will be exactly the same? Not sure I will find out.

And being light sensitive, I'd love the option to turn the LED off and having the &#34;regular&#34; background.  Yes, you can turn the light completely off, but the contrast is so &#34;dark&#34; compared to screen saving mode, that you essentially HAVE to have the light on to see well.

I contacted customer service when I noticed that all my books that were saved on my SD card were all deleted off my SD card. This is the SD card I bought from Amazon for the Kindle Fire. They checked my logs and looked at something else on their end and then said the files were corrupted! I ONLY used my Kindle Fire for books purchased through Amazon. I do NOT use it for anything else and do not purchase digital books from any other source so that means a Kindle book or books that I purchased from Amazon were corrupted and corrupted my Kindle Fire. The customer service representative then said the only way to correct it would be to plug in my Kindle Fire or the SD card onto my desktop computer. To do what?!? So it can corrupt my desktop computer as well!?! Are you kidding me!?! I have purchased over a thousand digital books from Amazon and this is the customer service they provide? I WAS a big fan of Amazon and loved their Kindles (I have several of them) and Kindle books...now I am just extremely disappointed with their products and their customer service.,1,2018-06-24,,True,,Do NOT buy Kindle or Kindle books!,,

I don't think I can connect it to the Internet and my email, a disadvantage when traveling.

The light can be very dim or very bright depending on settings and the device has an excellent screen.  The features of the kindle (highlight,notes etc...) run a little slow but I don't usually use those features so it doesn't impact my useage.

Keep in mind, with the backlight off, this kindle has the same screen color as the original versions. Mostly white in a well lit environment, but not perfect white in darker places, not a big deal. Now with the backlight on indoors or in low light environments it is indeed 'paperwhite'. I can already tell the battery life is not as lengthy as the kindle keyboard. Mostly due to the backlight. This is by no means knocking it down, I am quite satisfied with its battery life as I've had it for a few days and it's still in the 90s. Heavy internet use and high backlight settings will obviously lower the battery percentage quicker. Screen sensitivity is really good, thought I would miss the buttons but this gives it a more 'book like' feel.

This device is so much easier to handle than a book and I can read in bed with no lights on and see just fine!  The print is very crisp and going back and forth on the pages is simple. I can easily bookmark where I stopped and instantly be on that page when I power back up.

You don't need to have a light on in the room to see it so it bothers a sleeping partner much less. The battery lasts a long time. The case I got with it as a bundle fits very well and has automatic shut-off when closed. The only thing I don't like about the case is that when folded open fully, there is a metal piece that protrudes out the back and distracts me sometimes while reading as it rubs my fingers.",5,2018-09-11,,True,,Kindle Paperwhite is very nice.

However, it is considerably smaller than the keyboard Kindle, and I am finding it considerably more difficult to navigate.  So far, I haven't been able to get the WhisperSync to work to sync to my Audible versions of the books, nor even to navigate from chapter to chapter, or find things.

1088,1,"Ok. First e-reader. Finally broke down and bought one. The &#34;special offers&#34; discount means they are allowed to advertise horrible books with suggestive titles to you on your screensaver. (Trust me, don't fall for it.) Paying the extra money is well worth not having to put up with that foolishness. Secondly, I ask you, what person with a great love of reading only reads for 30 mins a day? The brags on the &#34;months of battery life&#34; are greatly exaggerated. I've owned this thing for 6 days. Needed charged 3 times. (So holds a charge for 2 days) I don't like the set up of the home page. No, take that back, I HATE the set up of the home page. The whole bottom of the screen is devoted to &#34;recommendations&#34; from amazon. How is that for inserting a bit of sneaky advertising!?! I don't need or want your &#34;recommendations&#34;. I don't care what everyone else is reading. I am a unique individual, have my own mind and opinions, and I am perfectly capable of choosing my own books thank you very much! This e-reader makes it difficult to switch back and forth between several books. Eg: Switching to a cookbook to find a recipe.The first book gets lost and it is a tedious chore to look it up again. I tried 'recents', but that did not work and had to scroll through my entire library. I guess the old kindle fire tablet carousel/lazy susan set up spoiled me. I really really miss it.<br /> The &#34;goodreads&#34; thingy is also strange. It seems to be a way to show off to others or have a contest to see who can read the most books. Once again, I don't care what other people are reading or what other people think I should read. (I don't announce what I buy at the grocery store or what color my pee is to my friends either.) What is it with you people? Announcing every minute detail of your lives and every vapid thought that crosses your mind to the world at large on social media seems to be some sort of requirement these days.",2,2018-04-07,3.0,True,,Meh.

1101,1,"The way that Amazon advertised this is that Kindle Paper White is always connected online to allow for instant downloads, etc.  Well, actually, there is theoretically some number of hot spots which you could ad hoc configure to connect with, but I've never seen them.  So, the user experience is that the Paper White is just as desperate to use my WiFi connection as any other Kindle I've owned has been.  Booh!  Amazon, you shouldn't tout a feature that is seldom available to most of your users in the normal course of usage.  It sets them up to be very Under-whelmed.

1108,1,"The Kindle Paperwhite E-reader is a great choice for an ardent reader who moves around a lot. If you are an expat, digital nomad, frequent business traveler (all of which describe me!), it's simply not realistic to lug around a mini-library of books. With a Kindle, you actually can! Since the device uses little battery power, it's ideal for lasting the duration of a round trip international flight. The paperwhite version better simulates the look of most common book paper. I believe there are now options that have a built-in SIM to utilize the 4G network, which is even better for book downloads. But, since most people don't download that often, I think this version with WiFi connectivity suffices just fine. Note, there's no internet browsing or apps (like the Fire) but if reading is what you are after, this is a GOOD thing.

1121,1,"My first Kindle was with the keyboard. I loved it And never had any issues. My husband purchased me a Paperwhite in December 2014 because it was backlit and I do a lot of bed time reading. I loved my Paperwhite and had no issues. Then came a beach trip last month. I put my Kindle in my beach bag and was going to sit away from the water. Well, the water had another plan and an unexpected wave came and drowned my beloved Paperwhite. I was devastated. I though maybe it was time for an upgrade, so I looked into the Oasis. After several days of researching reviews I discovered I did not want to take a chance on not liking it. I traded my drowned Kindle to Amazon and got $5 credit plus 25% off my new Paperwhite. I have it up and running fine. I highly recommend the Paperwhite. Neither of mine have had the yellow backlight like other reviews have stated.

I previously owned a Nook but one of the older ones and while it was nice, reading in the dark would hurt my eyes and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to read as long as I wanted to. Reading outside was a struggle as with the glare the screen would get. I had put down reading for a while and when I started back up I went back to reading actual paper books. Eventually going to the store to purchase books or ordering online got old and decided to start using my Nook again and that‚Äôs when I found out that Barnes & Noble no longer supported the Nook I owned so I did my research and decided to purchase the Paperwhite and I am not disappointed at all. It awesome for reading in any type of light and looks amazing outside with no glare what so ever!!!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn‚Äôt come with an adapter which wasn‚Äôt to bad for me because I have so many extra adapters laying around! And also it having no color kind of threw me off but I don‚Äôt need to see anything in color anyway. I love that nothing distracts you like notifications from anything else popping up. You can just focus on reading. If I need to look up a word I just highlight and the definition pops up along with so many other awesome features!

1127,1,"...then you definitely need to get the Paperwhite. I hate technology and I hate ""more"" but in this case, having a Paperwhite in conjunction with a Kindle, creates a perfect reading world. I've had a Kindle Fire for a number of years and would debate whether to pack it along when I expect to be waiting somewhere for a while. It's got a bit of heft, it's hard to read it outside without adjusting the settings and thereby maxing out your battery usage, etc. I finally asked for a supplemental Paperwhite and I love it! It was perfect on the beach and under a sun-mottled tree. I love it at the doctor's office and on my commutes, but I need the Fire otherwise because I use it for online 'stuff' when I don't want to be at my computer AND I find that (unless I want to be at my desktop), it's pretty much the only way to load books from my public library to my Kindle. Sending books through overdrive to my Fire somehow automatically also sends the book to my Paperwhite. And I can read on my Fire, put it down, pick up my Paperwhite and the system asks if they should advance the page to the last read on my Fire. It's kind of awesome. And I really hate to admit that.",4,2018-08-09,,True,,"If you read prolifically on your Kindle Fire,....",,
1128,1,"My last PW was running slowly...just slow enough to make using the thing a bit of an ordeal. So during a flash sale I took a chance and upgraded to this gen, having skipped the last, and was surprised that the UI had become noticeably more zippy. The lighting is more even (warmer, maybe?), and browsing content in the Kindle Store is now doable; not iPad-level interaction, mind you, but also not likely to induce throw-it-across-the-room levels of frustration.<br />It's also a marvel of restraint. At a time when websites and apps overhaul their UI's on a seemingly weekly basis, the latest Kindle OS makes complete sense, both simplifying the experience as well as extending its capabilities. Good job.<br />The only thing I'd like to see are hard (or better, SOFT) page-turn buttons so that you didn't have to re-position your grip to turn the page.

When my Kindle 3 died, sad as I was to see it go because it was very useful, it gave me the opportunity to get the Kindle paper white. I am really happy with the Kindle paper white. It is such an improvement in every possible way. It does not have some of the features that I previously had in my Kindle 3 such as sound. It does however, improve the reading experience in a number of ways. It's easier on your eyes in any light. Selecting what you want to read and how to navigate using the touchscreen is an improvement. To me it enables greater navigation in the book that I'm most often read which is a study Bible. Changing from book to book, chapter to chapter, making notes, leaving bookmarks, or all easier. I like the vocabulary builder function.

With the higher 300 ppi  I expected the text to look sharper, and I expected a big improvement with the lighting, and looking side by side there is very little difference, except the new Paperwhite has a yellowish background which at night is a little easier on the eyes. I only noticed this because of the side to side comparison to my original one. There is definitely less pronounced shadowing at the bottom of the new one.  The pictures show them side by side, the older Paperwhite on the left.  Both are set the same, Helvetica size 5 font and the lighting is set to 15 on both.<br /><br />Overall I like both of the Paperwhites, but unless you need a new one I don't think there is enough of an improvement to make it worth the upgrade, maybe wait for the next model.",4,2018-06-30,2.0,True,,Improved lighting but not a significant difference in the look of the text,,

For instance, when I download a library book, I have to check it out on the library web site. Then I have to click the link to Amazon and sign into Amazon to request the download. Then after that, you have to go into device management in Amazon and &#34;push&#34; the download to the reader, unless you are content to wait for your Kindle to sync with Amazon at some later time automatically.

You also save 2 steps going to the beginning of a book that you have read before.<br /><br />What I don't like... my old kindle allowed me to have dozens of books at my fingertips... so if I purchased a book thinking that I would read it at a later date, it stayed on the main screen until I removed it.  It appears that the paperwhite only allows three books, then you have to go to the archive.  I've never cared for the archive, with either kindle.  There's no fast way to find a book.  I guess if you start a collection, but that seems like a pain.  If you are going to limit the number of titles displayed on the home screen, you should be able to sort by read/ unread.  started/ finished.  You also turn the page on the paperwhite by touching the screen.  But there's not much room on the paperwhite to hold the device, so if you are shifting you are going to accidentally change the page.  It's much easier to lose the page on the paperwhite than it was with the original kindle.  Finally, the battery is nothing compared to my original.

Recently, on passing through an airport I had my Kindle in a backpack going through security. Well, although I think I had done this several times before, the device came out entirely erased (just the backlight functioning). After several weeks, still the same condition. Okay, I screwed up by letting the intense x-rays get to it, but I thought other owners should be aware of this possibility. I guess you need to carry it on your person, perhaps letting the personnel know that you have one. They could probably bypass all the invisible rays and get it back to you in one piece.<br /><br />I am thinking of getting another one, but first I will do a little research on what it takes to fry the Kindle innards, so as to prevent a reoccurrence.",4,2018-06-21,2.0,True,,Airport security process can damage the Kindle,,

The only thing I love about this is the screen - it is bright and easy on the eyes. I have an eye condition that requires bright light to see well and this did fulfill that need. However, if you want to feel like you are reading a real book, the bells and whistles on this will annoy you. You cannot go ahead a chapter or back in a single stroke if at all. It is touch screen but is too narrow to just touch the side to move forward a page without looking to make sure you don't hit any of the print which pulls up a help screen. Why do these developers think more complicated is necessarily better? Computers were supposed to make life easier - not more compicated. One of the attractions of reading a book is its simplicity in use and your ability to get involved in the story without being distracted by side issues.

The Touch's design also feels higher quality than the Paperwhite, which feels &#34;plasticy&#34; to me.<br /><br />I'm sure if I didn't already own the Touch, I'd have been totally happy with the Paperwhite.  Thought I'd throw this review out there as a different take to the many people gushing over the Paperwhite.  I returned the Paperwhite for my money back and am still going strong with the Touch.

On the good side, I can read my books just fine and really enjoy reading in bed with just the Kindle light. I'd love to have my old model back though. I don't like the touch screen features at all on this new model. If I'm not super careful, instead of turning the page with ease, I end up with the dictionary or a highlighter. I miss the ease of use of the buttons outside the screen. I also find the settings are more cumbersome on this model and shopping in the kindle store is not nearly as easy and efficient.

Imo there is no comparison of having phone or tablet as reading device vs reading device such as kindle paperwhite. This device is designed to be a subsitute for books and it does the best job at it, by having superb screen that is great for eyes (no fatigue - using natural light reflection), can read in direct sunlight, low power so no need to turn off screen after a minute. Ok there are many great things about the device.<br />I gave one star for the support of pre-owned devices. I purchased such 'like-new' condition device from local garage sale. Owners pefrormed factory reset so everything looked like new, no issues whatsoever. What I discovered later is that because these owners registered the device with kindle, I was unable to activate it with my account. Customer service said that the previous owners need to go through some process to release their account in some other way than they did already for me to register and that there is no other way to be able for me to register it.<br />So my happiness with the new device was very short lived as I couldn't locate the garage sale and previous owners and now I'm stuck with the device I cannot use.

The screen resolution is exactly where it needs to be to mimic reading a physical book, and the screen doesn't cause any issues with your eyes even during long periods of usage. When reading in dark areas, the brightness option allows you to trigger small LEDs at the bottom (&#34;bottom-lit&#34;) that will illuminate the screen. They can get pretty bright, allowing you to read in any condition. Even though the light back plays on the entire idea of using e-ink, it does allow you to read in the dark, and doesn't seem to cause any exhaustion to your eyes either (given, we kept the backlight to a minimal during our testing to help with this‚Äîso we only recommend using as much as you need and nothing more). Your ability to tap into Amazon‚Äôs massive library of electronic books is a plus, and the browser is simply ‚Äúok‚Äù (it‚Äôs there when you need it for simple browsing on WiFi). The version ‚Äúwith ads‚Äù isn‚Äôt annoying at all. You get a screen saver when not in use that will pitch a random book on Amazon, and a small banner at the bottom while browsing the library or store. These ads will not impede your experience in anyway, and are worth saving $30 (or so) with.<br /><br />Finally, the battery is one of the major selling points.

But it did - screen went haywire.  I have to increase the font due to my eyesight but I could still see a lot of the page on my original Kindle.  This new Kindle Paperwhite seems so small after the one I have had for so long.  Also, all my &#34;active&#34; books showed up separately from my collections on my large Kindle.  This new one lists them all on the main screen so I can't tell which ones I have read (that were in their own collection on my old Kindle) from the ones I have not read yet.  As many books as I have downloaded over the years, it will take a LONG time to go back and move them over to my &#34;read&#34; collection file again.

I have seen reviews that claim Amazon has replaced the unit, but I do not feel like going through the effort.

1632,1,"I own a B&N Nook that I've used for many years.  I got a Kindle for Christmas and while I like it a lot there are some features that the Nook has that the Kindle doesn't.  First, page numbers.  There aren't any.  A couple of books I've read so far have a percentage of what's left and the book I'm currently reading doesn't even have that.  How can there be no page numbers?  Next, the battery.  There is an icon of the battery that shows it being used but as far as I can tell there is no way to see a percentage of what's left.  All you had to do with the Nook was tap on the battery.  And most surprising is there is no ""currently reading"" option.  For example, I am currently reading a book and I went out of it to get some new books that I wanted.  Then I put everything in a collection so it stays organized.  The home page shows 3 books but they are the new books that I just got.  With the Nook all I had to do was tap ""currently reading"" and it took me right back to the book where I left off.  With that being said, the Kindle responds a little faster than the Nook and Amazon has a lot more free and low cost options for books than B&N.

I have had no issues with my 7th Generation unit and now use it exclusively for reading books.<br /><br />I simply love how the Kindle Paperwhite adjusts to various lighting conditions... how it lights up automatically in the dark so I never need a reading lamp. Conversely, the background darkens and adjusts to an appropriate intensity during daylight hours. It automatically adjusts to a perfectly readable level in all lighting conditions and has a no-glare screen.<br /><br />I love how you can tap and hold your finger on a word to obtain its dictionary definition. I would have gone with the wireless option if I had known how much I was going to use this feature... it requires an internet connection if it does not recognize a word and needs to access Wikipedia. However, connecting to WiFi is simple and works well.",5,2019-01-13,,True,,Fantastic E-Reader,,

I can still read in direct sunlight, the screen looks the same as the kindle e-reader.

1756,1,"I am admittedly a Kindle junkie. I have the original Paperwhite and it's still great, so why get a new one? Well I have teens who enjoy reading so I figured I could hand mine down. Glad I did!<br />Pros: *the lighting- it's 3:30 and I'm on vacation but wide awake. I can read on this without getting the blue light from say reading the Kindle app on my phone and possibly be able to fall back asleep later. Also I can read without it being so bright as to wake up my husband. It really does look like a real book page.<br />*Size- I got this and the Amazon leather magnetic case for it to protect my screen (I didn't with my original and it got tiny scratches from being in my purse.) It's small and lightweight, easy to toss in my purse to read when I am waiting in line somewhere.<br />*Options to customize- whether it's the font (I'm a font nerd and love this feature), text size, time left in the chapter/book/location/percent complete, spacing between lines, word wise (to get quick definitions of new or difficult words), highlighting, notes... So many ways to customize the reading experience.<br />*Ease of use- it's simple. No explanation needed.<br />*Long battery life and instant connectivity- charge lasts and lasts- I'm talking weeks, not days or hours. The ability to download a book any time, anywhere is wonderful. I was on vacation in the mountains, it's remote, and a storm woke me up. I decide to finish my book. Now what? It's 3 am and I'm in the middle of nowhere. The tv would wake up my family. I just purchase another book from the store and begin reading right then.<br />*Ability to borrow from Kindle and my county libraries plus First Reads. Kindle lending library and First Reads give me access to a ton of free books every month. Plus I can borrow library books from my community libraries using Overdrive.<br />Cons: Cost when not on sale. Honestly, other than the fact that I'm a teacher and so my salary (or lack thereof) prevents me from buying one for every one in my family is the only con I can think of. I purchased on prime day so I got a good deal or I couldn't have purchased.<br />Highly recommend this Kindle Paperwhite as well as the Amazon case with magnetic closure that fits it perfectly.",5,2018-07-30,,True,,Kindle junkie- I'm in love (again),,

I figured the paperwhite was a better fit for me since I mostly read on my kindle.<br />Maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm used to navigating on kindle fires but I have not liked the setup on the paperwhite at all.  When reading a book I can only do three different taps to make things happen and it‚Äôs frustrating to me.  Also, like other people mention the screen flashes black every like sixth page which just seems odd.  When tapping through the pages of books (on the fire you scroll which is better) the screen flashes black between each page This shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal but I‚Äôve noticed I can see an imprint of a book on the first page on the book on the next page which drives me crazy.<br />The screen quality is great and I definitely like how the paperwhite isn‚Äôt as heavy as the fire.<br />Overall, I wish I would have just stuck to the kindle fire.

1776,1,"Generally good as an e-reader for novels, but I've had to turn to other devices (Fire 8 HD tablet) for reading magazines, technical references, manuals, office documents, etc...  It feels slow, under powered, clunky when trying to quickly skim through looking for something specific, and very lacking on features compare to e-reader apps on Android & Fire.  That kind of defeats the purpose of an e-reader if a few whole categories of text aren't comfortable to read on it.  The lack of a micro SD card slot is annoying too.<br /><br />I have not bought any ebooks from Amazon for it because of stories about books being remotely deleted (over contract disputes or similar), that is not something I'll tolerate, the sale should be final, period, or else its merely a rental, which is free from public libraries.  The notion of tracking reading habits is creepy too.<br /><br />Ultimately I bought this over alternatives because of the low price on black friday, I think I got what I paid for.",3,2018-08-04,,True,,Good but disappointing too,,

But during the summer, out by the pool in the bright sunlight, and at night, while laying in the bed, I was envious of her Kindle E-reader.  I had to find shade in the sun and turn on the lamp at night.  Don't get me wrong, I loved my Kindle but I was a little envious of the new one.  Then, for my last birthday, my wife bought me the Kindle E-Reader.  I was so excited!  My wife is awesome by the way.  Because of the backlight I expected I'd have to charge it more often, but it runs forever just like my old Kindle.  My wife and I sit by the pool ALL summer so we love that this Kindle is so readable in bright sun.

It's so nice to change my books to different fonts, sizes and lighting strength to make reading easier depending on whether I'm wearing my glasses, or in the glaring sun or a dark room.  And the Kindle is so thin, it fits snuggly in most any pocket I'm wearing so I can bring my whole library with me, no matter where I am - waiting at an appointment, sitting in the car, outdoors on the deck, or just relaxing in bed.  Now I don't have to throw another book that's been read into a box in the basement or pay some of the high prices on store bookshelves!

1803,1,"I've been very pleased with my Kindle Paperwhite. I haven't had an e-reader since the Kindle Keyboard, which I liked, and I expected this one would be great as well. I have not been disappointed.<br /><br />Initially I was worried about the responsiveness of the touchscreen, especially since it's an e-ink display, but so far it's worked very well. The screen is very easy to read outside, inside, and in the dark. I have not yet been in any lighting where I had difficulty reading the display; it always works well.<br /><br />Overall, the lighting of the screen is a fantastic feature. For my Kindle Keyboard I had a light built into its case, but having the internal screen light like this is much better. My only quibble is that I dislike how the lighting is slightly uneven along the very bottom of the screen. However, as you can see from the photo I took of the lighting, this is very minor, and I'm not taking any stars off for that.<br /><br />The interface is streamlined and easy to use, and newly purchased or borrowed books appear within seconds on the Kindle, which is great. Whispersync and everything else with Kindle features all of course work well. The Kindle has a couple of dictionaries built in, which is also a very convenient feature. I've even enjoyed using the flashcards feature on it to review the words I've previously looked up while reading. It's a nice little feature that I wouldn't have thought I'd use, but I actually like a lot.<br /><br />Overall, this is the best e-reader I've come across. I have no major complaints at all and would not hesitate to recommend this to a friend.",5,2018-10-14,2.0,True,,Very happy with this e-reader,,
1804,1,Have a fire tablet which I like but wanted something for my books that was lighter to hold and easier to read without the eye strain and glare. I purchased the paper white and have been so happy with it! This kindle is easy to use and comfortable to hold for extended periods. I can read longer without getting tired and enjoy it‚Äôs smaller size compared to the fire tablet. It‚Äôs much easier to carry on a daily basis and has me looking forward to reading even more. I definitely recommend!,5,2018-10-14,,True,,Great,,
1805,1,Never got to use it because I couldn't find anyone who was able to connect it to a wi fi.  It is probably defective.  I wouldn't recommend this particular kindle.  It sucks.,1,2018-10-14,,True,,Unable to connect to wi fi network.,,
1806,1,"I've wanted a Kindle forever but was hesitant due to the fact that it relies on Wi-Fi and my apartment complex doesn't have reliable Wi-Fi due to metal inside the walls. When I received a Kindle for my birthday, I was determined to make it work, Wi-Fi or not.<br /><br />Amazon Live Chat entered the Kindle details into my account. I thought that took care of the registration, but you still have to connect to Wi-Fi to register it. Most of my friends are senior citizens and none of them have Wi-Fi, so my only option was the public Wi-Fi at Lowe's. I downloaded a couple books from my library to get me started.<br /><br />I realized how easy it was to transfer books using a USB cord.<br />Access my Amazon account on a computer<br />Click Content and Devices<br />Under show select Books<br />Click the first box next to the title you want to transfer<br />Click the second box next to the title and select Download And Transfer Via USB<br />Books are stored in the Downloads folder on your computer<br />Plug one end of the USB cord into your Kindle and the other end into your computer<br />Drag and drop the Kindle files you downloaded into the Documents folder on your Kindle<br /><br />What about the Kindle's other features vs. not having Wi-Fi? The dictionary feature works as long as you have at least one dictionary installed, you can install additional dictionaries from Amazon. The dictionary feature allows you to click a word and get the definition. Wikipedia works in a similar fashion, but Wikipedia will not work without Wi-Fi.<br /><br />The vocabulary builder and flash card functions work without Wi-Fi. When you click on a word to get the definition, it's added to vocabulary builder. You can then use on screen flash cards to study the words and definitions until you master them. I love learning new words, so it's been a lot of fun. Select mastered when you are familiar with a word.<br /><br />Deleting books from the Kindle is easy. Plug the USB cable into your computer. Click on the Documents folder on your Kindle. Highlight and press delete to get rid of books you don't want to store on your Kindle. Deleting them removes them from your Kindle but not your account, you can download them again at any time.<br /><br />I love the feel of a book in my hands and thought I'd miss that feeling. But I love the way that the Kindle feels in my hands. I also appreciate no disgusting library books that have been who knows where, and lost bookmarks that fall out of books I'm currently reading. No ripped pages either. I now prefer Kindle reading over reading regular books.<br /><br />Durability wise, I'm not sure how the Kindle will be long term. I've babied it since I got it. The only drops it's had were off the bed and onto carpeting. The Kindle was not affected by either of the drops. Battery life has been impressive, 16 days on average reading 4-6 hours a day.<br /><br />I love how the Kindle is the perfect brightness, whether I'm in bed reading in the dark or reading out in the sun during the daytime. I also love the fact that it's silent so I can read in bed next to my sleeping partner and he doesn't wake up. The light is not so bright that it keeps him awake.<br /><br />Free books has been one of my favorite things. I've only paid for 4 books out of the nearly 24,000 books on my Kindle. Amazon offers many free books in each category, you just have to take the time to look for them. I use Book Bub to notify me of sales on my favorite authors books so I can purchase them at a discounted price.<br /><br />Other features I love about the Kindle include the reading progress which shows me how much longer it will take me to finish a chapter and finish the book based on my reading speed. I can adjust the font size to a comfortable level to turn every book into a large print book, no longer am I paying extra for large print editions of regular books.<br /><br />I really enjoy the no ad's version. It was $20 more than the ad's version, I'm not a fan of advertising so this was a no brainer for me. You can purchase the no ad's option at the time you buy your Kindle or at any time in the future. Another feature I enjoy is being able to add notes to books, especially when I'm reading the Bible or classics I love.<br /><br />I dislike that it is not Audible compatible, even with an external speaker like the cheaper and more expensive Kindles. The screen is only black and white, and I read books to kids a lot, so I wish it had a full color screen. Turning the Kindle off is buggy, I often have to touch the on screen option 5-6 times to get it to turn off.<br /><br />I hate the fact that not all Kindle books are compatible with the Kindle Paperwhite. I tried downloading them using Wi-Fi away from home and also using the transfer mode at home. I get most of my books for free but if I paid for books I would be upset, since Amazon's website let's you &quot;purchase&quot; the books even if they are not compatible.<br /><br />If you were looking for a basic Kindle review, you can stop reading here, and don't hesitate to buy a Kindle. If you are curious about the incompatible books, I have included a list below. The books listed below are not compatible with the Kindle for PC or Kindle for Android software in addition to being incompatible with the Kindle Paperwhite.<br /><br />#'s<br />12 Snow Days Of Winter<br />13 Words<br />2 Monster Books For Kids<br />25 City Adventures For Families<br />53 Strategies To Get More Listings<br />60 Ways To Hurt Someone Halloween Edition<br />8th Round Epic Book 1<br /><br />A's<br />A-Z Of Poo<br />A Band Of Angels<br />A Best Friend For Woodstock<br />A Children's Story About Cells<br />A Crash Of Rhinos<br />A Fabulous Fair Alphabet<br />A Guide To Being A Friend<br />A Hero's Journey<br />A Home For Leo<br />A Is For Animals<br />A Isn't Just For Apple<br />A Mama For Owen<br />A Special Day With Dad<br />A Tale Of A Lady Labrador Dog Named Gemma<br />A Tale Of Two Friends<br />A Tiger Tail<br />A Very Brave Witch<br />A Visit To The Barber Shop<br />A Color For Sketch<br />A Hungry Lion<br />A Place For Everything<br />A Whiff Of Pine A Hint Of Skunk<br />Aarti &amp; Chalisa Collection<br />ABC's Alphabets For Kids<br />ABC's On Wings<br />Abraham Mount Rushmore Presidential Series<br />Abstract Coloring Book<br />ACT Prep Study Guide<br />Al The Story Of A Vegetarian T-Rex<br />Albert's Ballgame, Birthday, Christmas, &amp; Halloween Books<br />Alfred The Time Traveling Dinosaur<br />Ali An American Champion<br />All Ears All Eyes<br />All Night All Day<br />Allison Rose &amp; Her Dancing Toes<br />Alpha Beta Chowder<br />Anatomy Book<br />Andy &amp; Sandy First Snow &amp; Adventure Books<br />Animal Coloring Book<br />Animal Noises<br />Animal Numbers<br />Animals &amp; Insects<br />Annalise's Up &amp; Down Day<br />Annie &amp; Snowball Magical House &amp; Pink Surprise Books<br />Are We There Yeti<br />Art Barn<br />Atlas Of Human Anatomy<br />Austin The Astronaut<br />Autumn Days<br />Avocados Fully<br /><br />B's<br />Baby Bear Counts One<br />Baby Bedtime<br />Baby Love<br />Baby Loves To Party &amp; Rock Books<br />Baby Blessings<br />Baby's First Day Of School<br />Balancing Act<br />Ballyhoo Bay<br />Baseball Is<br />Basil Fully<br />Batman Strikes Back<br />Be Mine<br />Beach Coloring Book<br />Bear &amp; Hare Where's Bear, Fishing, &amp; Snow Books<br />Bear &amp; Squirrel Are Friends<br />Bearded<br />Beastly Babies<br />Beautiful Butterflies<br />Beautiful Mountains<br />Because Dragons Love Milk<br />Bedtime Bubble Rhyme<br />Bedtime Mischief<br />Before We Met<br />Bella The Mermaid Saves Her Pet<br />Bella's Very Wonderful Day<br />Ben The Penguin I Have A Wish<br />Benny Learns A Lesson<br />Benny The Blue Fish<br />Best Food Forward<br />Bet On It<br />Big Bug<br />Big Cats<br />Biggest Kiss<br />Bike On Bear<br />Biology Coloring Book<br />Bitsy Bee Goes To School<br />Bitty Bot<br />Black Space<br />Blucy The Blue Cat<br />Blue &amp; Bertie<br />Blue Goose<br />Bo &amp; Friends<br />Bob The Sailor Man<br />Boo<br />Books For Kids Shapes &amp; Colors, Marvin's Monster, &amp; Littlest Fairy<br />Boom Boom<br />Boom Boom Go Away<br />Boy And The Traveling Cheese<br />Boy Wonders<br />Breathe<br />Brimsby's Hats<br />Broom Zoom<br />Brownie &amp; Pearl Hit The Hay, Make Good, See The Lights, &amp; Step Out Books<br />Buck's Tooth<br />Bugs At The Beach<br />Build It Up<br />Bulldozer's Big Day<br />Bumpety Dunkety Thumpety Thump<br />Bunnies &amp; Rabbits<br />Busy Bug Builds A Fort<br />Butterfly Garden<br /><br />C's<br />C.R.

1810,1,"My first kindle was the second generation. I adored being able to use the buttons to search for new books and turn pages. And the battery lasted a month at a time easily! The ONLY downfall was the need for an external light to read at night.<br /><br />That being said, I cannot day enough good things about my new kindle. I take it everywhere, sleep with it, wake up to it, it‚Äôs never out of my sight! I finally figured out how to work the digital library which makes my love of books a much less expensive venture.<br /><br />There is zero glare, and the back lighting is beautifully adjustable. I have taken this to the beach and read outside in the brightest light and ready in my firehouse in the dead of night while we wait for calls. Sometimes when I‚Äôve lost my glasses at the crack of dawn, I‚Äôve used the brightest setting to see my way around.<br /><br />Even when using the back light, the battery life is as astounding as some of the early generations of the kindle. I‚Äôve owned this kindle since the latest Amazon Prime Day (mid July sometime) and have only needed to charge it 4 times.<br /><br />My only complaint is the touch screen. I would much rather rely on buttons to turn the pages and make adjustments. You have to make sure you‚Äôre touching the screen in the correct spot in order to get it to do what you want. Likewise, if you have larger hands, your fingers may end up moving you to the next page or increasing the font size accidentally.",5,2018-10-14,,True,,Addicted to my Kindle,,

The good part is that it is black, small, and tucks easily in my handbag or carry-on.

I use one of my kindles daily and get so much enjoyment from them. The battery life lasts forever without having to constantly charge. They hold so many books. One currently has over 900 books downloaded on it. It‚Äôs great to use while outside in direct sun because it has no glare. I can also use it late at night and not keep my spouse awake because I can read in the dark due to the backlight. I also like that you can adjust the font so it‚Äôs easier on my eyes. I love them. Worth every cent in my opinion! I will never be without one.

1817,1,I am pretty much house-bound so my main concern was being able to check books out of the public library. I had been using a Nook for several years. But when I had to replace the Nook I found that the new Nook does not work for that. After trying to get help I had to give up. My new Kindle PaperWhite worked right out of the box.

Amazon offered trade-ins on select older E-readers, but not my serial number.  After purchasing the new and improved E-reader, I just wanted to send the old unit back to them, with no refund expected, as I hated the prospect of throwing it in the trash.

The drawback is that the iPad is heavier and more tiresome to hold. This new Kindle takes some getting used to and some setting tweaks to make it readable. You've got to experiment with all of the settings to see what works for you. I wish the Kindle's user controls were as good as they are in the Kindle app on my iPad.

1849,1,"Privacy Paralysis in Customer (Dis) Service<br /><br />Have had a problem with content on my Kindle not showing up on-line on the Amazon Kindle web-site, and therefore not synching on my IOS devices either. Customer service based in Philippines is awful. They did give me a timely response to my late-night request, but the reps are so rule-bound by privacy concerns they would not simply change my email address from an old, abandoned email (the domain is no longer even in service), to my current gmail address. They required a confirmatory phone number to contact for verification that I am who I say I am, but that phone number has not been used for at least 3 years and is likely owned by another user now. They offered no reasonable work-arounds. They vaguely said there were only two (of many) book titles on that email, and said that I must have other ebooks linked with other emails, though they wouldn't tell me those other listed emails either, even after answering all of their secret privacy questions. This is Customer Diservice. Too many hurdles, jump-throughs, hassles just to get what I have paid for and is lawfully and legally mine. You can change my email over the phone in about 30 seconds. I've recently done it before with other companies. After 45 minutes of round and round, I have deregistered my Kindle, and will be selling my Paperwhite on Ebay. Anybody want it?

1850,1,"Of course, I still wish they would put a, 'night mode' on these readers. I know about the ghosting and any battery problems, but I think the consumer should make those decisions, not kindle. This is so annoying simply because at ever page turn, it shows the potential of a black background/white text setup.  The designers INSIST you don't need it, but EVERY other reader incorporates it. Maybe I will try again in a few years.<br />Back to the review.

1854,1,"So I got this as a replacement for my Kindle Voyage (I wish they would still make that one! I loved it!) and I was strapped for cash and they were having a deal on the paperwhite or I would have gotten another voyage (refurbished since they no longer make it) or an oasis (looks too wide for my tastes).<br /><br />Let me start with the positives:<br />Lightweight, feels great in the hands, pretty responsive screen, the text has gotten better somehow, the battery life is very good, there are endless cases for it, its a perfect size for fitting in my front laptop bag pocket or the inside pocket of my jacket.<br /><br />Now the negatives:<br />Backlight, backlight, backlight. Now I don't understand why they don't put an ambient light sensor in this model that changes the brightness automatically. Several times now I have turned off the light and gotten into bed to read before going to sleep and the backlight on the Kindle is mysteriously not lit. So I need to use my phone light or turn the light back on so I can see the screen to pull down the settings and go into the light brightness setting. It's annoying. And 9/10 times the brightness setting is on 5 or more and yet the light did not turn on when I opened the case. I can even push the power button a couple of times and still, no light comes on until I pull up the settings. Also, there should be a way to switch from ""white/blue"" light to an amber light for night reading. The backlight on the voyage was much less bright and didn't wake my partner up but this light is bright like a cell phone light and I've never had to turn it up higher than 4-5.<br /><br />Overall though, this Kindle is a great product unless you do a lot of night reading like me, since 9/10 nights I have to make sure that I open the Kindle and turn the backlight on before I turn the lights in the room off.",3,2018-11-26,,True,,Backlight needs improvement,,

But I'd like this exact thing with an 8"" screen.<br /><br />The OS is miserably slow. But once you have your book open and are just reading, that's not important.<br /><br />On my iPad, I can comfortably read smaller text. But the iPad costs $800 more than this. So, after adjusting my unrealistic expectations, I decided to keep it and get used to it.<br /><br />Most people with decent sight will love it.<br /><br />Oh, ""non glare"" is completely not true.

Ok... it's a little smaller than I would like, but still usable especially since of course you can expand the size of the fonts.  Lights work fine and it's light to hold.  My one big complaint however, is the battery.  Even when you turn the device technically &#34;off&#34;, whatever type of battery they're using simply does not hold a charge over time.  This happened with my old Kindle, too.  I have other devices that use lithium batteries and they can sit for weeks or months without use and there's still a lot of battery left in them.  Maybe 3 weeks of no use with this Kindle and the battery is drained to, or nearly to, zero. This again is with it off.  Since they are very slow to charge this can make it inconvenient if you haven't used it in a while and suddenly have the urge to read, pick it up, and bam - no battery and an hour or more to wait for a decent charge for it.

First of all, after two days of messing with it I still can't figure out how to get books from my public library loaded on to it.  Second, I find it very frustrating to adjust the lighting.  I wish I had not thrown away the packing materials or I would return it.<br /><br />I was very frazzled when I was messing around with this the other day.  Seems like I had the poor luck of choosing a book that had preferences not allowing it to be downloaded to a kindle.  After this review, someone from Amazon actually called me which still amazes me.  While I had purchased a book and thought I had a handle on how the thing worked, it appears my frustration caused me to get in my own way.  Also, the document Amazon sent to me was far superior to the kindle book and info I had already found.  i still think this kindle operates too slowly for the price I paid, but I am going to give it more of a chance.

1882,1,"Let me preface my review by saying that I am an Amazon Prime customer and buy many many things from Amazon. Probably too many things! However after reading all the reviews about the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite and how people have spent sometimes two to three times talking to customer service returning their Kindle receiving a new Kindle because of different issues I decided not to buy my Kindle Paperwhite on Amazon. If there are so many complaints then something should be done because I did not feel like returning it and going through talking to customer service reps. Having said that this is an amazing little device and I am extremely happy. Previously I had bought a Kindle e-reader and I could not stand it so I returned it because it wasn't worth my 80 bucks. I have been reading for so many years and I went to college for writing/ literature so I have read tons of books and as a result my neck started hurting me and I switched to audiobooks. I collected first editions and classics, they decorated my house however I stopped reading until I finally decided to get a Kindle Paperwhite. I got my Kindle on eBay! I actually bid on a used Kindle from a seller with excellent reviews. I am a faithful ebayer for about 25 years and because I am on disability and  wanted to have a lot of Electronics I learned how to use eBay and much to my satisfaction I have had no problems. Same goes for my Kindle Paperwhite. Yes it is indeed White. I don't know why people get Kindles that are gray or beige from the people that own and make the device! I love that the light in the background makes it so easy to see that I forget to turn on the light in the room and I am still reading!  So now I am reading (not just listening,) to books again and I am very happy as I said before and I have no regrets especially after losing a few auctions for the Paperwhite I finally won and paid less than $67! That makes me even more happy! Thank you Amazon making such an excellent easy way to enjoy books. Sorry I did not purchase one from you but nonetheless I still thought I'd write a review because this is an awesome e-reader!

Pages switch easily and the lighting is perfect. Really easy on the eyes.  I debated for ages whether I should get the Oasis, or an iPad mini, but I really wanted something just for reading and couldn't be more pleased.<br /><br />I did order the one for $99 at first (with special ads) because ads never bothered me on the HD, but I called the day I received it and paid the extra $20 so there are no ads.

So I‚Äôve a had a paper white for a few years, been pretty happy with it until a few days ago when it automatically applied a software update over WiFi. Since that day, the paper white has been stuck in a constant loop of stutting off and turning back on. Two touches to the screen cause it to turn back off again. I spoke to amazon customer ‚Äúservice‚Äù multiple times via phone and chat. After going through the trouble shooting routine they told me the device is not broken it‚Äôs a software problem. They then said they can‚Äôt fix the software and would offer me a %15 discount on a new kindle. So, I‚Äôve got a $119 paperweight. Buyer beware. Amazon will not support their products beyond the 1 year warranty even when they admit that the issue is their own software. I‚Äôve googled this issue, and it appears to be pretty common. Is this a diabolical plan to render older devices that are in perfect condition unusable with a virus in order to force the customer to spend more money, or just terrible software and support?

Upon contacting Amazon, there was nothing that they could do since the device was purchased in 2016 and is out of warranty.  I know the cracks are small, but try reading books like this and tell me how much would this bug you with every page you read...<br /><br />Well, to be fair Amazon did offer a 15% discount on the purchase of a new kindle device;  but why would I spend about $108 (after tax) on a new device when the first one malfunctioned for no reason?

1981,1,"Let me first say I have always preferred physical books over electronic ones. I never wanted anything to do with ebooks. But, a lot of things my library has that I wish to read are in ebook format. I had a Fire 7 tablet and it gave me migraines if I looked at it for longer than 20 or 30 minutes at a time. Reading was out of the question. So, I finally snagged the Paperwhite during the Prime Day sale.<br /><br />I couldn't have made a better purchase! I've been using this thing non-stop since and I've only charged it twice! Once when I first got it and I don't even remember the other time.<br /><br />The screen is fantastic. It's actually like looking at a physical book. I had it out by the pool and the sun was directly shinging over me and it honestly only served to make the display look even better. Now, I can borrow all of those library ebooks I have been avoiding and enjoy them without getting a migraine just because I want to enjoy a good book.<br /><br />If you are looking for an E-reader and have light sensitive eyes or get migraines easily (especially from electronic devices) this is the perfect one! The light can be set as low or as high as you need. I've never set it higher than 10 out of 24 except when I first got it to see where my perfect comfort level would be. 10 is absolutely perfect for all light levels from pitch dark to brightest sunshine.

2060,1,"I purchased the Kindle Oasis last year and I love it.  It is light and the screen is crystal clear.  Since the Oasis is somewhat expensive and I tend to lose things I purchased a Kindle Paperwhite on Prime Day to use  when I am travelling.  I REGRET THE PURCHASE!  In comparison to the Oasis it is very heavy and cumbersome. I am not sure when they use the description &#34;lighter than a book&#34; what book they are referring to - it must be the IRS Code and Regs. The Paperwhite that I received is defective, it has shades of gray and black at the bottom of the screen - basically looks like a cloudy, overcast gray skies.  I received a replacement today (original one was received two days ago)  but I have not opened the package as if it is defective I don't want the headache of dealing with Amazon Customer Service.  We should be allowed to bill companies for the time we spend dealing with customer service to resolve issues.  Note this review is for the white Kindle Paperwhite.<br /><br />08/02/18 - I GAVE UP<br /><br />I ended up returning the replacement Kindle Paperwhite as it had the same issues.

2064,1,"I've been trying to fall in love with the my Paperwhite for 6 months.  It is awkward to use.  For me, the lighting makes it more difficult to read than other devices.  I've had a Kindle Fire for years, and the battery life had really diminished. Time for a replacement before a trip that would have limitations on when I could charge it.  Based on the Amazon descriptions and comparisons, I chose the Paperwhite, and wish I had not.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Screen does not rotate.  I often turn the screen to horizontal or want the cover to open on the other side.  The Paperwhite limits you to one vertical option for display<br /><br />No audio - While I love to read, I also enjoy audiobooks, especially when travelling.  Sadly the Paperwhite has no option to listen to Audible.  This seems a significant shortfall. The lower priced Kindle Fire works great with Audible.<br /><br />Lighting / print is very particular.  It is designed to look at from one angle only.  If you shift the angle the print becomes blurry and difficult to read.<br /><br />Advertising has increased to ridiculous.  It takes several steps to get to your book.  Obviously far more interest in getting you to buy more than to serve as a reader.<br /><br />PROS:<br />The size is nice.<br />Texture of both the front and back is handy for holding.<br /><br />Bottom line, I will pass the Paperwhite along to someone else.  I'm going back to the Kindle Fire.",2,2018-07-04,2.0,True,,"Skip Paperwhite, other Kindles much better.",,

I still have trouble &#34;swiping&#34; the pages ..they jump back and forth and I have trouble at the end of the book transferring to the next one.Unfortunately the original simple one I had froze up and could not be repaired so it was replaced by this one.  I guess maybe I'll have to settle for what I have but I miss my simpler one which I was told is no longer available.  I'm sure younger tech savvy people will have no trouble with this one.

I do not like the fact that the control for text size comes up accidentally as often as it does when I swipe to turn the page; I do not like having to readjust the size so often.  Can the text size control be taken off the page turning swipe?  I do not like not being able to read the titles nor the percentage left of the books I have when I bring up my library in grid form; there is no way I know of to make this better.  Can the book covers not be presented more clearly and the percentages read not be given in larger size numbers?<br /><br />I love to read, and having a Kindle makes that easy.

2139,1,"I'm an avid reader, and I take my Kindle everywhere I go. It is so light, and it fits in my purse. Ten minutes waiting here, twenty there -- are no big deal for me. I pull out my Kindle and read. Great when you have active kids, and you find yourself waiting for them at school or at practice. My favorite time to read is before bed, and I just lower the brightness and read until I get tired. I also love the choice of reading any book from my Amazon collection, which is presently over 500 books. Sometimes I take a break from one book to read another, depending on my mood. Also, I am an English teacher and can switch books in a few seconds opening to the last page read. I love everything about this Kindle. It doesn't have the glare of my iPad, and I can read outside in the bright sunlight. The kindle has so many options, including bookmarks, highlighting, vocabulary definitions, and you can change the font size in seconds. Highly recommended device.

The replacement also suffers from it, but it is not as bad as the first product I received.<br /><br />The other issue is the screen color temperature differs from Kindle to Kindle. My first Kindle had a much warmer screen which made it much more pleasant to read on at night. My replacement has a much colder screen which is unfortunate.

With the light off and wifi on, reading at least an hour on a typical day, I only have to charge it about once a month, maybe every three weeks if I'm really reading a lot.

2304,1,"This low rating is really more for the customer service.<br /><br />I love the kindle itself.  Easy to read on, screen clarity is good.  Works well in all lighting conditions.  Very useful.<br /><br />But after just over a year it's gone kaput.  Battery symbol on screen with an exclamation point inside.  Frustrating, but I figure it just needs to be reset.  After navigating to some support FAQs, I try all the things that should make it a happy kindle again, but nothing works.  Bummer, but these things happen, and I do use it quite a bit.  And happy days, its still under warranty!<br /><br />This is where things get stupid... I send an email to customer service/support.  I list all the trouble shooting steps I've taken.  I get an email back saying they have received my email, and will send me another email after they actually read it, telling me how to fix it.  Then I get another email saying the same thing.  Then I get a 3rd email, the next day, with a whole bunch of unnecessary superlatives, that tells me to go through the same trouble shooting steps I've already taken.  So, its pretty clear that even though the 3rd email is the actual response to my issue, indicating that they have read my support ticket... they still haven't read my email.<br /><br />So I say to myself, &#34;Self, it's the digital age.  Perhaps having a person respond to this email (even though they still haven't actually read it) makes some magical difference, and all the steps I've already tried  (multiple times) will now work!<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />But lo and behold, there is a &#34;Call&#34; button on the bottom of the reply telling me that if doing again, all the things I've already done, still doesn't work... to call!<br /><br />So I do.  I actually choose the call me back option thinking this will be cool.  I can actually fold the laundry or something instead of sitting on hold.  But alas, it was a trick.  I get immediately called back from a number in Washington, and a robotic female voice tells me how sorry she is and to please wait on the line.  Oh lord, stuck on hold again!<br /><br />Eventually I get connected (to a person who seems to be much further away than Washington, and who perhaps speaks English as a second language) and think I'm in business.  Wrong again.  After more unnecessary superlatives, we proceed to go through the same trouble shooting steps I tried multiple times on my own, and again in response to my unread email.  This time I don't talk to myself though, thinking it might make a difficult call even more confusing.  After a few half hearted blinks, my kindle decides to continue to pout and refuses to start up.<br /><br />Transferred from tech support to extra better tech support.  More unnecessary superlatives, like its getting weird now, but at least we don't go through the trouble shooting steps again.  Instead, we need to connect my recalcitrant kindle to a computer.  Any computer I ask?  Yes, any computer.  So I plug it into my handy little chrome book.  Nothing happens.  It begins to dawn on me that maybe my chrome book isn't up to the task of beating my kindle into submission.  I'm not a tech guy, but luckily I've been transferred to extra better tech support, and this guy is ready for Luddites like me.  Just as I'm about to say something, he asks what operating system I'm using.  I need windows or Mac OS to perform this extra better tech support factory reset operation.  So not any computer, but one running windows or Mac OS.  Ahh I say and boot up the mac book.<br /><br />I wish I could say my tale of woe ended here.  But the factory reset was not to be.  Nothing happens.  Well, I did dust off my mac's keyboard, but nothing happened with my kindle.<br /><br />So I got transferred to extra special better tech support.  And after answering a whole bunch of questions about whether I had ever dropped it, let my dog use it for a chew toy, let it engage in extra marital shenanigans, or other behaviors unhealthy for young kindles, it was decided that since my kindle still had 44 days left of warranty left, I could ship it back for them to look at.  At this point, I balked a little.  Maybe a lot.  I use this kindle on a daily basis to actually teach my kids, and it's already been a school day without it.  I really don't want to wait the weeks it will take to ship, repair, and ship back before I can continue with our history and reading assignments.  More hold time.  Another transfer.<br /><br />And then, another new voice on the line (with yet more superlatives that don't actually fix my problem and get kind of annoying), another glimmer of hope.  Will she be the one to finally fix this stubborn kindle?<br /><br />No.  She wont.<br /><br />But she does have the authority to ship me a new kindle and expedite it so I have it for school on Monday.  That's pretty good.<br /><br />I'm bummed that it crapped out after just over a year.  I'm really bummed at the ridiculous tech support (seriously guys, read the emails first, then reply).  I hate that Amazon thinks that thanking me a zillion times for being an amazing, awesome, wonderful prime member somehow makes up for 3 hours of getting transferred, waiting on hold and pressing the same buttons I've already pressed on my kindle for two days.<br /><br />But overall, it's a good device, I've enjoyed using it, I'm happy they are replacing it, and I'll be glad to get the new one.",3,2018-06-02,,True,,"Pretty Good Device, Pretty Bad Service",,

Since I only use it at home I haven't bothered to get a cover - it works great just as it is.<br /><br />My two grips are: 1) Uneven illumination at the bottom of the screen.  Apparently this is due to the placement of the LEDs and is common to this model.  If you keep the light level low this becomes less noticeable, but it's always there, like a faint smudge.  Not a deal killer - just one of those things that would be nice to fix. 2) Lack of any buttons (other than power).  Would be nice to have page-turn buttons and maybe a Home button so you wouldn't have to touch the screen for everything (touches are sometimes misinterpreted and they eventually get the screen dirty).

When my first paperwhite started giving me small issues I didn‚Äôt think twice about replacing it with another kindle paperwhite.  The reason the paperwhite will always be my first choice for an e-reader is because of the light.  It is perfect for reading in bed at night.",5,2018-06-02,,True,,Great E-Reader,,
2539,1,"I'm so disappointed. This is the second Kindle Paperwhite I've purchased.  There is nothing wrong with the device itself; it is the system of sharing books that renders this device almost useless. (I love the one I got for myself; the only drawback is that I can't read the Hoopla books that I check out from my local public library, but the Nook Glowlight 3 has the same limitation. You must get a tablet e-reader that supports apps to use Hoopla.)<br /><br />I purchased this e-reader for my kids to use at bedtime. (They're not allowed to read on their iPads at bedtime because I'm concerned the light from the backlit screen will keep them awake.)  Years ago (before Amazon Households existed and before there were parental controls for the Kindle), I set up a second Amazon account so I could buy & check-out library books that my kids could read on the Kindle App for iPad without them having access to my not-child-appropriate books. I was excited when Amazon rolled out Households because I hoped I'd be able to connect my second account to my main account and finally have access to all the books. (My son's Rick Riordan books are in the second account, and I enjoy reading them too!) Unfortunately, Amazon would not allow me to assign that account to my teen because there was already content in that account. (Frustrating for me, but I understand they're trying to prevent people from &#34;gaming&#34; the system and listing everyone they know as a family member to share books and Prime. If my husband weren't already connected as the 2nd adult in our household, I could have connected the books from my 2nd account to the family library that way, but he is, so that's not an option.) So, unless I want to repurchase them, the kids' books in my 2nd account can never be connected to the family library.<br /><br />I decided I could live with that because they've outgrown most of those books, so I'm losing very few that we'd actually read again anyway. I proceeded with setting up a teen account and a child account connected to my household and was unpleasantly surprised again! Teen accounts DO NOT WORK FOR BUYING OR CHECKING OUT BOOKS! My son's teen account is only good for using Amazon's shopping app & for Prime Video.  (Amazon Teen accounts seem to be designed to get teens shopping, not reading!)<br /><br />Registering the Paperwhite to my teen's account renders the e-Reader completely useless, so my only options are to (1) register the Paperwhite to my account or (2) have my teen take over my 2nd account. If I go with Option 1, my child & teen CANNOT CHECK OUT ANY E-BOOKS FROM OUR PUBLIC LIBRARY; Amazon requires me to buy/check-out all books and then share them to the child/teen account, but BORROWED BOOKS CANNOT BE SHARED WITH CHILD & TEEN ACCOUNTS (except for Kindle Lending Library books)! Nearly all the e-books my kids read are checked out from our public library, so, again, the Kindle Paperwhite is nearly useless. (All the books I checked out in anticipation of getting the second Kindle Paperwhite are stuck in my main Amazon account with my not-child-appropriate content; I would have to hand them my Kindle with no restrictions for them to be able to read them because I CANNOT share them with child or teen accounts.) If I go with Option 2, I cannot restrict my teen's ability to purchase additional books, and he cannot use the Prime Lending Library because I only have Prime on my main account.<br /><br />Think very carefully before buying this if you intend for your kids to use it!",2,2018-06-02,,True,,Doesn't work well with Teen & Child Accounts,,

This seems to only happen with books as I can stare at that screen longer when doing other stuffs.

My experience has been that the charging port on the kindle gets loose and eventually no longer charges, at which point you have to replace the kindle.  That being said, it usually happens over a matter of years NOT MONTHS.  I had to buy this new kindle in October because of this problem happening to my old one, but I had had that one for a few years, and charged it weekly.  Considering that one of the main selling points of this version of kindle is how long it holds its charge - to find that I'm experiencing this problem already is totally unacceptable.  Furthermore, when speaking with tech support the rep tells me that I cannot have it replaced because it got damaged from being in my bag!  What absolute nonsense!  I countered by asking if I am expected to carry around my kindle in my hand  at all times - to which she actually replied YES!!!  imagine.  I spoke with a manager/supervisor and my kindle is being replaced albeit with a refurbished one, which I don't think is really fair, considering I've only had this one for 5 months.  I'm hoping that perhaps I got a lemon, otherwise I'll just use my iPad.",1,2018-03-13,3.0,True,,Nightmare,,

2646,1,Bought my kindle probably about a month ago. When I first step it up I was a little hesitant about it. When I was browsing through the kindle store app the picture quality for the books was horrible. There is a huge difference when you are looking at the kindle store and when you start reading the book.<br />But I fell in a love when I started reading the book. The light adjust to the light of the room. So if I‚Äôm reading at night the screen gets brighter but it doesn‚Äôt hurt my eyes. I like that I can tap on a word I don‚Äôt know and get the definition. I like that I can save lines from the book if I like a quote. I like how lightweight it is. It fit right in my bag for when I‚Äôm on the go. I like how long the battery life lasts and how quickly it charges. I like how it tells me how long it will take to read the chapter. I like how I can borrow books from the kindle store. You only need WiFi when you want to download books so I‚Äôm happy I didn‚Äôt get the 4g version that cost more.<br />The only thing I don‚Äôt like is how it comes with a charger cord but not the wall piece so I have to use my phone wall adapter.,5,2018-08-13,,True,,Works great,,

I love going to the book store and spending hours upon hours, deciding which ones to purchase. Holding it in my hand, falling asleep with it on my lap, hearing the actual pages turn in murder mystery plot. It was an experience. But after a debate with my boss, she was gracious enough to let me borrow hers & she even downloaded my favorite book. I was hooked from the start. So, for Christmas, my beautiful sister got me one as a gift and presented me with it right before a planned holiday vacation. My favorite part about the eReader is that I can travel with as many books as I want, without having to lug around a heavy bag.

2676,1,"I had to replace my old Kindle after a baggage incident with American Airlines (they're reimbursing me). I really didn't want to get a Paperwhite - my old, basic Kindle was perfect for me. But by the time I would have bought a new one with a lighted case, like I had before, it was going to cost more than the Paperwhite and a basic case. And American is only reimbursing me so much money, so I had a budget. I took a chance with the Paperwhite, and I think I'm going to be very happy with it. The resolution is supposed to be much better but I can't tell much of a difference. I like the built-in lighting and the fact that I can adjust it up or down. My old Kindle didn't have a light, and the lighted case was actually a little too bright, which was bothersome if I was reading in total darkness. So this new setup (Paperwhite plus a basic case) cost less than the old version with a lighted case, and seems like it will be a great replacement. Time will tell, but so far I'm very happy.

I talked to customer service they finally agreed to replace it after cajoling them, BUT not really. Lol. Read on!<br /><br />Since I bought the Kindle in China (I'm from the US) before moving back to the US, they won't send a replacement kindle to the US. They will only send a replacement to ""a friend living in China."" Lol. They are telling me I need to ship my Kindle to a friend in China, then that friend needs to ship the Kindle to Amazon China, then Amazon China will ship a replacement to the friend in China, who will THEN ship my replacement Kindle to me back in the US.<br /><br />First of all, that whole process will cost me as much as the Kindle is worth. (I've shipped many things back and forth between China and the US and it's expensive). And second, I don't have a random Chinese friend that can take care of this for me. Amazon US claims they ""can't help"" because the Kindle was bought through Amazon China. Yeah right. What is this customer service? It's the same company. Make it happen. You have the means. Instead you're going to force your customers to go through this expensive nonsense process that's impossible anyway because I don't have someone in China that can do it? Ugh.

At that point, the battery-charge life declined.  At this date (9 months after purchase), I can only read about 2 hours before recharge (3-4 hours).  Thus, I keep it plugged in and recharging during reading which defeats the purpose for which I purchased it.  Anyone know if one can replace the battery?  In any case, buying a Paperwhite every 9 months is good for Kindle and bad for my pocket.

I am never going to buy a kindle book from the store because they do not sell books in the language I read books there. People say they can be removed through the chat, but I was told that they cannot do it for me. The always coming up arguments are they do not interfere with the reading, but how is it not interfering if everytime you open the cover and have to swipe once to get rid of the ad? You people seem to be brainwashed by the kindle app. Hate all you want but this is my argument. Then if I hate it so much I should pay 20 dollars to get rid of them right? It is exactly what ransomware viruses say when they capture your files on your computer. Anyway, there is only one way to remove those so much hated ads and that is not adding or removing your kindle account from the device. It converts the device into and offline paperbook, no wifi, no dictionaries or any online features but this is much better than seeing the ads. You won't even need to scroll to remove useless ad pages when you wish to read and wanna see a page of your book when you open the cover. Gotta buy your books elsewhere and have to convert them to kindle format using Calibre though. I should have got an ebook reader instead of kindle.",3,2018-12-17,,True,,Special offers are terrible,,

I have constant pain in my shoulder and it's lightweight enough that it doesn't hurt to keep it in my purse. The backlight is perfect for indoor or outdoor use. The battery life is fantastic.

2815,1,"I've been a Kindle user for many years and absolutely love the format and ease of use.  What I don't like is the Kindle hardware itself seems to have a limited life span, maybe 18 to 24 months, before performance becomes erratic and essentially renders the unit unusable.<br /><br />Let me define erratic as not be able to connect to the Internet; total restarts required multiple times a day to clear a problem; displaying error messages saying &#34; An error has occurred&#34; followed by useless instructions not related to the last operation; plus other disruptive sequences which I've come to interpret as time to get the wallet out and buy a new reader.<br /><br />Spending literally hours on the phone with technical support has never resulted in a successful resolution of a problem.  After one particularly long and aggravating session with technical support, the parting comment was, &#34;Well, it is out of warranty&#34;.<br /><br />It's really beyond me why Amazon cannot produce a Kindle that's reliable and can continue to function for more that 2 years.  I was really interested in buying a Voyager until it occurred to me, why spend another $100 with no reason to believe that version would last longer.",3,2018-07-08,3.0,True,,... been a Kindle user for many years and absolutely love the format and ease of use,,

2817,1,"Just upgraded from 5th Generation Kindle.  Did so because I sensed that 5+ year old Kindle battery was losing its umpfh.  Agent told me that the new Kindle would be 8th Generation [turns out to be 7th] and that the battery would last up to 3 weeks!  It hasn't come any where near to lasting a week during the first week+ that I've had it.  Did I get a lemon?  I turn it off when not in use, and only use it roughly 2 hours daily.  I must say, however, that it is slick in transferring all my old Library contents [200+] to the new Kindle.  Again I'd been misinformed - being told that I would have to initiate each and every book transfer -- NOT so.  Of course that error was regarding a benefit.",2,2018-07-08,,True,,Doesn't measure up to the hype,,

2823,1,"It took me years to become comfortable with an ereader. I love the feel and smell of books. However, I needed to make a decision between purchasing more bookshelves (and finding a place for them) or moving to an ereader. I'm a first generation user of both the Nook and Fire. Once I moved to the Kindle Paperwhite, I loved it! It reads just like a book. There's no glare or eye strain. I can select font style, size, and background color, as well as other options like highlighting and taking notes. It's lightweight, durable, and easy to use. An added benefit...saving trees! And, if you fall asleep while reading, you don't have to worry about bending pages. When my current paperwhite is full, I'll buy the next generation paperwhite. Also, my son loves his Kindle Fire (he reads both hard copy and Kindle books), and my 83 year old mom loves her Kindle HD 8.

2838,1,While I love the size and idea.  I hate that it is so difficult to see what I've ordered.

2841,1,"This was my third or fourth Kindle. My first was the keyboard Kindle, and I have enjoyed every one. This is the first one I bought that did not have the page turn buttons. I found I was often pressing the wrong part of the screen and pulling down the menu. Also, apparently I often read with the Kindle in my left hand while doing things with my right like petting my dog, it was annoying to have to stop what I was doing and touch the screen, rather than just push a button with my thumb. I do not need or want backlighting, so that is not a selling point or bonus for me. The ads are more intrusive and annoying. I miss the game Every Word; I always play it while traveling. I do not care about having a touchscreen. I use a Kindle rather than a tablet for a number of reasons, so the features that keep the cost of the Kindles going up don't appeal to me. I returned this. I'll keep reading on my old kindle with lower dpi, but with page turn buttons and the navigation button!",3,2018-04-25,,True,,Unnecessary features make it unfriendly and awkward to use and pricey.,,

I started an eChat with Amazon customer service and their suggestion to resolve amazed me.  They sent me a link and instructed me to download the updated software to my laptop and then connect the Kindle via USB to get the software on to the device.  For a minute, I thought I was Marty McFly and I had been transported back 10-15 years.  Every iOS/Android phone periodically updates the software wirelessly.  I mean really....when was the last time you connected your iPhone to your laptop and opened iTunes to update the software?

I keep getting directed to buy a book and it is irritating. I would not have bought it if I'd been aware of the advertising all the time and the way it's set up it practically grabs your credit card and purchases for you.

2932,1,"I can't think of anything other than the car that I bought that brought the same amount of satisfaction of incredible utility. I must say, the Kindle Paperwhite is marvelous in every sense of the word and has broken every barrier I set for my belief regarding ebooks. I have four hundred-ish books in my room and while I enjoy having them around me, I have to admit that I do have finite space. My Kindle has around a hundred books on it at the moment, many of which physical counterparts would be the size of textbooks given their length and content, so it has saved me a tremendous amount of space. Additionally, I very much enjoy the features provided by the kindle such as highlighting, making notes, creating collections, having an onboard dictionary, and a vocabulary builder that keeps tracks of words I highlight to find their meaning; much nicer than having to flip through a<br />regular dictionary. The screen is very easy on my eyes and I love how I can read it during any time of day and always have the ability to adjust the backlight, as well as to be able to read in essentially any position due to the fact that the Kindle can be handled very easily with one hand.<br />All and all, I can say for certain that this is well worth the price; which is incredibly fair, if I may add.",5,2018-05-27,,True,,Lovely.,,

2942,1,"I bought the Paperwhite for two reasons.  I wanted to read books on Kindle and thought it might be a good means to do that.  Second, I had a digital subscription to the Wall Street Journal that I wanted to read in a convenient manner.  Using the laptop means sitting in the office in the morning.  I could read it on my phone but the screen is uncomfortably small.  Kindle advertises that one can read the WSJ on such devices.  I ordered the devise, installed my books and was quite satisfied with the quality.  I then tried to install the WSJ and discovered that you have to have the Kindle edition.  I could cancel my current edition, which costs me $95 a year, and buy the Kindle edition, which costs $28 per month, about four times as much.  So, I will read my books but stay on the computer for the WSJ, which defeats half my purpose.  Amazon says that had I researched I would have found that the device does not support the normal digital edition.

I wish it would have some way of telling you how big each book is...under 50 page, 50-100 page, 100-200 page etc, in some way, maybe 1-5 dots under each book to reference size. If I have an open weekend, I'd like to have a nice fat 350+ page book to read.<br /><br />I love my Kindle, best gift I ever received, by far over and above anything!  I would never be able to go back to not having one.<br /><br />I love books, and this is perfect for book lovers.  Plenty of free ebooks available if you want to offset your purchase for awhile. A huge amount of books priced at $0.99 each.  Free and cheap does not mean bad books, they are fantastic.<br /><br />I love reading outside at night.  I don't need to turn on any outside lighting.  I like having my Kindle along with me in my purse so I can read a few pages if I'm waiting for an appointment, or if we are going on a long drive I can read although its hard sometimes when the other person wants to talk the whole way :-)  I can read at night before bed, no bedside lights needed.  It works well outside during the day, no glare which is great.<br /><br />I do recommend not removing books when you are not near your wifi.  I'm not sure but I think that was causing issues and eventually locked up my kindle. I was lucky and had the extra warranty and was able to get a replacement in 2 days.  I won't hold that against the kindle either.  I have had my replacement for over 2 years now and haven't had any of the issues I did before.<br /><br />If you think it costs a lot, think of how much you spend on books in a year.  You honestly don't have to spend much on books, although I probably bought 50 of the $1 books in the first 6 months, a bunch of free and my ""splurge"" is a $3 book.  Some are getting pricey for an electronic book but I don't have to buy them.  I can stay in a budget and I read more than ever before and don't spend anywhere near what I would have each year in paperbacks.  Just do it!! You will not regret it.",5,2018-11-23,,,,"Wish library pictures were bigger, otherwise love it",,

3053,1,"This is the second book I have read, and it has no page numbers. That is incredibly frustrating when discussing the book, or referencing it for additional information later. It only provides ""Percent read"" or some strange location feature.<br /><br />This problem cannot be that difficult to solve. Barnes and Nobel Nook books all have page numbers.<br /><br />You can read a book without page numbers. I can read a book without page numbers.  But when you and I get together, and say, what page are you on? I would say, oh, i'm about 9 percent through the book. Then you would say, oh, so Raskolnikov killed the pawnbroker, and her sister! What did you think about that? did you see it coming? I would say, what! He killed her sister! If we had both been reading with page numbers, that fatal accident would have never happened.<br /><br />Overall, the Kindle is okay. I like the ""minutes left in a chapter"" feature, and I like that its a higher DPI, but I don't think I can tell the difference. The only reason I switched from the Nook glowlight is because it appears that B&N is no longer focused or making e-readers.<br /><br />I also wanted to mention about the advertisement version vs the add free version. I have the one wit the advertisements. I can spend 20 bucks to remove the ads at anytime. They don't bother me, its only on the lock screen that the adds show. So, i would save 20 bucks and go with the ads.<br /><br />O right, the paper white has Goodreads support. You cant write a review after finishing reading your book. But, it is supposed to give you the option of buying your recommended books after you finish whatever you are reading.  I haven't been able to get that working right, yet.<br /><br />Its a sad day that Barnes and Nobel has decided to stop pushing their e-reader. But, to be honest, they sunk too much money into a product that they could not recover. Unlike Amazon, who has obviously decide to do the bare minimum to attract customers. It shows.<br /><br />Fortunately, I am old enough to realize that this product will be pushed by the wayside by some brilliant competitor in the next 2 years, and I will be the first to jump on that product. I have no loyalty to the amazon e-reader, and I have no desire to stick with it. As soon as something better comes along, I will be the first person to jump ship. No amount of ""I am sorry"" or ""We can do better"" will change my mind. Lets be honest, Amazon isn't the first, and certainly not the best. I say this because its obvious that what Amazon advertises that this e-reader can do, doesn't do it.<br /><br />Ah well, there is always regular old paper books.",2,2018-09-03,,True,,No page numbers,,

3055,1,"I love reading on the Kindle Paperwhites!  I own several of them.  Most loved is the backlight and the dictionary feature.  Now that I can instantly get a definition, the hardest thing about reading a real book is not having that definition.  Somehow, making a note and planning to look up a word later seldom actually happens!  Great for packing in many books for a vacation - no suitcase required!  Only thing I wish is that the device is becoming to ""connected"" - I don't want all the goodreads and constant syncing, and certainly don't want to see notes from random other people!  Please keep it simple on the Kindle eReaders Amazon!  If I wanted to be connected with my reading, I would read on an Amazon Fire or other type of tablet.  The beauty of the eReader is that it is JUST FOR READING!  I have many Kindle eReaders and like the Paperwhite best.  The ""buttons"" for page turning on the Voyage require too much pressure to be easily used without thinking about it.  The page turn buttons on the 3rd Gen Kindle Keyboard are smooth as silk and you can turn the page with barely a movement of the hand with backward and forward on each side of the device so it's easy to change hands to hold comfortably.  My ideal Kindle would be the Paperwhite WITH the 3rd gen Kindle Keyboard page turn buttons.  Also, I found that when I was helping my mother and her friend - age 88, that arthritis in the hands worked best with the Kindle Keyboard page turn buttons because it didn't require reaching a aching knarled thumb or finger to touch the screen - and then only option on one side on the Paperwhite, or having to press firmly right on the specific spot on edge of the Voyage.  Also, the added depth at the bottom of the Keyboard version gave a little more area to nestle into the palm of her hand or rest it on a pillow without blocking the screen.  It allowed my friend with arthritis and macular degeneration to read again, set on the largest font, for another 4 years!  She could not do that with the Paperwhite.  Great products!

A difference in the new one versus my older one is the screen on the older one is more pleasant.  It was a bit smoother and this one is a bit rough.  There is some discoloration to the bottom of the screen which my older one didn't have.  Not a deal breaker but a slight annoyance.  I also think my other one was a bit more touch sensitive.

3081,1,"I have to say that this Kindle is a step backwards. After two days, I‚Äôve only been able to put about 25% of my Amazon books on it, and 0% of my other content. Collections have to be started from scratch. I have kindle unlimited, but I can‚Äôt get the new books I check out to appear, even in my ‚Äúall‚Äù screen (vs ‚Äúdownloaded‚Äù screen). What idiot programmed this?<br /><br />I‚Äôm also sincerely confused as to why they got rid of text to speech. Gen 3 was super, super slow, but far more flexible. The touchscreen on this gen 7 is also rather muddled. It‚Äôs easy to bring up things you don‚Äôt want, or to change pages in the wrong direction. I assume that‚Äôs just me still getting used to the new interface.<br /><br />Good points?  The memory is greatly increased as compared to the nearly useless gen 4.  It‚Äôs much more speedy compared to gen 3. The settings and such aren‚Äôt overly complex, and airplane mode isn‚Äôt buried in settings.<br /><br />I am not impressed, though. Where are my books. An e-reader that doesn‚Äôt download books is useless.<br /><br />‚Äî<br />Updated. It‚Äôs been 5 days. I‚Äôve so far gotten only half my Amazon books synced to this crappy kindle, and  as before, 0% of my non-kindle content migrated over. This is ridiculous!

The downloads continue to start and stop.<br /><br />I created some new collections, but they disappeared yesterday. I don‚Äôt really feel like putting my thousands of books into new collections just to have them randomly disappear.<br /><br />This kindle is worthless crap. The programmers should be fired. I‚Äôd suggest Amazon hires at least one new one that actually reads books on a Kindle. I‚Äôll update if I ever get all my content to download.

I read every night - I travel with it - it's the best thing ever.

I love that it's my book and nothing else.  It works like a charm, and I am so happy with it.  I purchased the one that includes the ads - to me it was worth the savings to have the ads pop up.  Here's how it works: there is always an ad on the lock screen, usually for another book, sometimes for a TV show or movie.  I don't know if that lock screen is standard on all kindles [ads and no ads] or not.  Then there is an ad [usually that same featured ad] in a small bar at the bottom of the screens when you are in the cart, your home screen, looking through your library [I think], etc.  There is no ad when you are reading the books, and that's what matters to me.

However, the feature I love most of all is the &#34;x-ray&#34;. Tolstoy LOVES introducing characters who appear very seldom or only once in the massive novel, and having kindle's X-ray feature is an ingenious tool to tell me how often a character's name is said, when they first were introduced, and what is being said about them.

3194,1,"The experience of READING the Kindle Paperwhite deserves five stars. I'm giving it one star because of a technical flaw in the device's port that should have been Amazon's responsibility, regardless of warranty status.<br /><br />It took me a while to figure out what was going on. At first I thought I just hadn't kept track of how low the battery was. Then I read the Help section and followed the hint of using Airplane Mode to save battery, and also trying the Restart and Reset options. But still, sometimes the device would charge and sometimes it wouldn't. Kept thinking *I* was doing something wrong.<br /><br />I read some more of the Help section and saw the recommendation to always use a specific Kindle charger and cable. Fine. Purchased those. At first they worked OK, but then the same problem resurfaced: sometimes the device would charge, and sometimes it wouldn't.<br /><br />By the time I phoned Amazon and they agreed with me that the port was faulty, I was told that the device was three months out of warranty and that I would have to buy another, or purchase some other e-reader if I wasn't satisfied with the Kindle. So, in other words, the $120 we spent for the device have been wasted, and the device itself is useless, because of a flaw that Amazon should have have been willing to fix. Maybe $120 is nothing to the 1 percent, but to the rest of us, that's a good chunk of money, and we don't expect that the high-tech device we purchase will become completely useless in a matter of months. To say nothing of the money I've spent on all the Kindle books I've purchased. Amazon should warn people about this flaw in their design--and better yet, fix it!",1,2018-04-01,159.0,True,,"Flaw in the port renders the device useless, and if you don't figure it out before the warranty expires, you've lost out on $120",,

Only note is that Amazon adversities this as having a month long battery, but I would like to say that if you are an avid reader (using it more than once per day, perhaps for a few hours per day) then it lasts about a week or two.

3231,1,"I spent a good month trying to decide whether or not to upgrade to the Paperwhite over my older Kindle Touch. I read hundreds of books on my Touch, and I didn't think that I would really need another e-reader for a long time. As the new Kindles have come and gone, I haven't really had much interest in them, as they all had the same core function.<br /><br />However, the one thing that always bothered me was the fact that I needed a light source in order to read my Kindle, which was especially frustrating on flights, where I was trying to use those crappy overhead lights to kill 5-7 hours of time. So, The idea of a backlight in the Kindle sounded good to me, as long as it wasn't blinding or glaring. Anything seemed better than having to strain my eyes over a lamp and being confined to a single spot on the couch.<br /><br />Cautiously, I ordered the Paperwhite and the official Kindle leather cover (I really enjoyed the older model, even if was overpriced) and expected the worst.<br /><br />I didn't really think that the &#34;paperwhite&#34; stuff was going to be anything other than marketing jargon for a now-whiter screen. Whoop-de-doo. In reality, the screen is slightly sharper and the letters are a bit easier to read, and I found that I enjoy the whiter screen in comparison to the older more yellowed screen. Nothing to get super excited about, but it's definitely something. I probably wouldn't have upgraded for just that, but that leads us to the back light, which I love.<br /><br />What I enjoy the most is the new back light. I've always been less than impressed with this kind of thing, because normally it feels like the light is tossed into devices as an afterthought rather than a main feature. However, I feel like they went to great lengths to create a comfortable back-lit reading experience, and I think it's one of the best back-lit devices that I've ever used. I don't feel like I'm actually reading from a lit device, such as a phone or tablet, which kills my eyes after a short time in the dark. It just feels like you're reading naturally, if that makes any sense at all. It's very impressive. You can adjust it from a blazing white torch that sears your retinas all the way down to a whisper of light that you can barely see, and it really works wonderfully with the device. I laid in complete darkness with the brightness turned very low, and read for several hours without eye strain. It was great. On the plane, I turn it to about half-brightness, and it's perfect. Plus, the light is so unobtrusive that it doesn't disturb anybody around you. Even at full brightness, it's not as bright as a cell phone or anything like that.<br /><br />The UI is a bit snappier, but unfortunately still quite slow. I don't care that much because I'm just using the device to read, but I think the experience would be a bit more pleasant if navigating through menus was faster.<br /><br />Finally, I love that the device wakes itself from sleep when I open and close the cover. I always disliked having to mess with the bottom button on my older model, and on the Paperwhite I don't think I've ever touched the button.<br /><br />Overall, I consider it a worthy upgrade from the Kindle Touch, which was the hot new thing not too long ago. If you use your Kindle a lot, you're going to love the new features and feeling of the device. It's great for travel or if you read in the evenings and want a softly-backlit book. However, if you only occasionally read, then you would be fine to stick with your older model.",5,2018-04-01,,True,,Great Upgrade From Kindle Touch,,

3329,1,"This is my first e-reader and I was skeptical about buying it (would I ever even use it?) but it went on sale and I figured I could always return it if I wasn't a big fan. Thing is, I love it. I purchased the case (link below) that automatically turns off my Kindle when I close the cover. I bought the version with ads and aside from swiping once when I reopen the case cover, it's a non-issue, that's the only time you see an ad anyway is taking it out of sleep mode. The lighting isn't technically a backlight but it has a similar effect and it's super useful in dim or dark environments without causing eye strain. Battery life is fantastic as it only uses electricity when you turn the page or cause the screen to change. Even the browser works fairly decently if you're just pulling up something text based like a recipe or a fanfic story. It seemed slow at first but once you actually start reading a book it's not noticeable (turning a page in a paperback takes more time than going to the next page on the Kindle). If you've ever read a classic or any older book that uses words not commonly part of your vernacular, the ability to highlight and instantly define the word is amazing.

Another option is landscape mode which P-White doesn't offer. I've gotten so used to the colors of the books and magazines on these devices, which Paper White doesn't have. It is wider than my phone screen, but not much larger. Sometimes I think I may as well read on my phone. I haven't had an occasion to read outdoors, which is what I bought it for. It is light-weight and I can see now why it isn't necessary to have a case as it can be propped up with a pillow or just held.

The Paperwhite is finicky and unreliable. The screen freezes and forces me to do a reset. Today it just wouldn't turn on at all. Turns out the battery was completely drained. I don't know why because I keep it plugged in all the time. The battery life is appalling (maybe a day or two max) even though I keep it on Airplane mode and keep Whispersync off and the other features like screen refresh etc. I am SO disappointed in the battery life. I have to keep this thing plugged in constantly if I ever want to feel any certainty that I can use it on the road. I hate the home screen and to search for anything in my library is a pain. I dislike the touch screen. I just want my simple kindle back. If I could return it I would but I can't. How can the new version be worst than the old one?!

I have Libby set up on my phone, which I log into using my library card, and within a few seconds I can find an ebook, borrow it from the library, and its downloaded on my kindle and ready to read.

3475,1,"I have been considering the Kindle Paperwhite ever since it was first released, but never made the purchase until recently.  I have been using the kindle app on my IPad, my IPhone and even on my desktop and therefore convinced myself that it was not a needed purchase.  However, as summer approached, and I knew I would be going on a cruise, I decided to buy when Amazon offered it at a special price with installment payments.  I am so pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it!  I could not believe the difference between the paperwhite and my tablet or phone when I was out in the bright sunshine.  Until I got the paperwhite, I had given up on reading at the beach or any outside event.  Although it operates a little bit different than the kindle app, it is easy to learn.  There is no glare, it is the perfect size to hold in one hand, the font can be changed and resized, the charge lasts for days not hours.  I also purchased a vertical flip cover case at little cost for extra convenience.  If I had to say anything negative, it would be that I wish books in a series could be sorted in the order that they should be read.

All of the features integrated into it, like the dictionary, highlighting, and automatic bookmarking, make for a great reading experience. The Goodreads integration makes it easy to track what you've read and to discover what you want to read next. My only real complaint is the sensitivity of the touchscreen. It doesn't always respond immediately and sometimes it will jump two pages. This doesn't happen often, and isn't a big pain when it does. The overall package of this reader is top notch.

After a horrific half a day, I finally went to my computer. Pulled up Amazon Kindle and opened up the User Guide. Read more than 50% thru before I understood the mechanics of Touchscreen. This I had been unable to do from my new Kindle as I couldn't get past the opening screen. I am not technically retarded as my computer days go back to DOS. I felt like I was learning how to drive an auto, but having only the car and a key. 'There you go mate'. I'm not too old to learn, But a little guidance would have helped.

3566,1,"When I found this Kindle on sale for Prime Day, I had already been considering getting a new eReader for a while. My old Nook from 2010 had a huge crack in the screen and was gradually getting slower and slower, and though I hadn't read anything in nearly two years due to work and personal commitments, I'm the kind of person that when I buy something, I make sure to use it. If I spend money on a new eReader, I'll make sure I didn't waste that money, which is exactly why I wanted to buy a new one - to get me back into reading.<br /><br />After comparing prices and specs on pretty much every eReader option available, I settled on either the Kindle Paperwhite or another Nook GlowLight. To me, having a backlight is essential since I often read at night before bed or in situations where there isn't much light, like a nighttime car ride, and even in situations where the area is dimly lit, like in my living room while my wife knits, it can be hard to see a screen with no backlight. So after narrowing it down to those two options, it became a matter of price, and since Prime Day was just around the corner, I decided to hold off until then to see if there was a sale.<br /><br />Boy, am I glad I did. The Kindle Paperwhite was $40 off, making it just around $80. And I couldn't be happier with my purchase.<br /><br />Since getting it, I've loaded most of my eBook library onto it using Calibre, and I've read six books so far. The Kindle is just as easy and intuitive as my old Nook was, and runs so much faster! The screen is much more crisp and clear, and my new favorite feature is its Goodreads integration so I can share my progress and discuss books with my friends directly from my Kindle. All my books were in ePub format, so I had to convert them before I could put them on my Kindle, but Calibre made that extremely fast and easy, and I highly recommend Calibre to anyone using an eReader since it's a very powerful eBook library program that's totally free. After converting my ePub books to AZW3, I was impressed that there were no formatting errors, something which has been a problem with other file formats in the past (especially PDF for some reason).<br /><br />The light on my Kindle is brighter than my Nook was, and I love the fact that it's always on. With the light off, there are many situations where the screen was readable but ugly and dim, but with my Kindle the light comes on automatically and makes the pages actually look paper-white (apt name, right?).<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that I can't set custom screensaver images. On my Nook, I had the sleep screen rotating through the covers of some of my favorite books, which was a fantastic little detail that made it feel classy, whereas the Kindle shows &#34;special offers&#34; on the sleep screen which are never things I'm actually interested in. There's a way to pay to remove the special offers, but even after you pay, it still will only show generic Amazon screensavers and won't let me import custom images. To me, this is a ridiculous oversight, since it would be incredibly easy to just have a folder where the images are pulled from and let me put my own images in that folder to replace the generic ones. But really, that's a small gripe, and I knew about it before I bought my Kindle, and I bought it anyway because it was so much cheaper than the Nook.<br /><br />Of course, my Nook vs. Kindle comparison should be taken with a grain of salt, since my Nook was so old and they've made newer models since then. But overall I'm liking my Kindle even better than my Nook, especially with the Goodreads integration. The Kindle's menu interface is very user-friendly as well.<br /><br />On a side note, Kindle Unlimited - I'm not sure if it's worth it. I got a promotional 3-month subscription for $0.99, and there are a few good books on there (notably, the Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, as well as the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling), but the vast majority of Kindle Unlimited eligible books are self-published, and there are very few books by any authors whose names you'd recognize. When I first got Kindle Unlimited, I thought it was going to give me access to borrow ANY Kindle book, but it's really a small selection, and the names I searched for (Chuck Pahlaniuk, Stephen King, Ted Dekker, Isaac Asimov, etc) were nowhere to be found. So it's definitely worth the $0.99 for me to read the Harry Potter series and re-read the Lord of the Rings before I inevitably purchase the eBooks to own, I don't think I'll be renewing my subscription once the price goes back up.",5,2018-08-05,,True,,"Better than a 2010 Nook, fwiw",,

3585,1,"Amazon markets this as suitable for use by children.  I have four sons.  I purchased one of these for myself, but my high school aged son co-opted it, so I bought a second in February of last year.  Recently, I noticed a crack despite NEVER mishandling nor dropping it.  It is in a waterproof rough case.  Customer service wasted an hour of my time sending me to 3 different people.  They never requested a photo and offered me a 15% discount to buy a new one.  Why should I reward poor quality with a new purchase?  I was intending to buy three for my sons today, but instead I ended up reading online how other people had the exact same issue.  It looks like this is manufacturing defect in some of the items and they pawn it off as consumer error.  I think that there are likely enough people who are having this problem that it should be investigated.  Amazon markets this a long term use product, for adults AND CHILDREN.  It should last more than the one year limited warranty.  I feel cheated and defrauded.  I have tablets older than my first grader that HAVE been dropped and yet have held up better.  Even the Amazon tablets we own have taken abuse, yet show no signs of injury.  Don't buy this and expect it to last.  It might.  It may not.  I was happy.  Now I'm not.  Now I'm just annoyed and frustrated and I'm sick of Amazon saying one thing - we've had issues with getting credits for late Prime packages - and doing another.  I absolutely would not buy this for a child.  I will not be buying another.  I was really excited about the waterproof upgrade and the idea that I'd be able to get a grown up case instead of my rugged case.  Ha!<br /><br />UPDATE:. I spoke to a rep from Amazon who tried to convince me that this isn't marketed for kids.  I told him I received adverts for a children's bundle.  He told me that those adverts were for the tablet.

3617,1,"Story Time:<br /><br />My first kindle was the kindle keyboard and I loved it. I still love it, and if it hadn't broken, I would still be using it because it was amazing. My case had a light on it, so I could read in the dark and everything. After it broke, I transitioned to the kindle tablets. I still have one that I use occasionally, but it's too bright when I'm reading before bed. I've wanted a new e-reader for awhile now, so I took the plunge. I did way too much research and read every review before deciding to get the paperwhite.<br /><br />About the paperwhite:<br /><br />I bought it refurbished to save money, and honestly it was totally worth it. The reader came completely scratch-free and working perfectly. I bought it with ads, but I think I might get rid of them because they're more annoying than I expected. I'm fine with the ads on the home screen (the kindle fire has those too so I'm used to it), but the banner at the bottom of the screen makes me feel icky. Still, I think it's better to buy it with ads first just to see if that bothers you or not because you can always pay to remove them later. UPDATE: It's been a month and I don't even notice the ads anymore. I purchased the wifi only version because I usually just read at home, and I can download any books I want before trips. The kindle was smaller--about the size of my hand actually--and wider than I thought it would be, but again, I'm getting used to the change. I bought the black version and am very happy about it because when I read at night it's like the screen is floating in the darkness. And that's why I wanted the paperwhite anyway: to read in the dark. I would never buy the standard kindle because there's no point if I can't read at night.<br /><br />Why I took away a star:<br /><br />I think it's too expensive for what it is. It is simultaneously high and low tech, which is both good and bad. I like that it resembles my old kindle keyboard, but I expected more of a difference. The screen is a touchscreen, but it's difficult to go back a page because most of the screen is dedicated to going forward. The display is also a bit tricky and it's tough to add things to collections because you can't easily scroll through the library like you can on the tablets and app. I know I'm nitpicking, but I did expect more based on the raving reviews. Don't get me wrong, I love it, but there is a lot I think could have been done to improve it that also isn't a feature for the voyage nor the oasis even though it seems doable technologically speaking. Also, the battery life is shorter than I expected, but only because they advertise it to be longer than they should. UPDATE: I love it still and have gotten used to the way it works. I think it's one of my best purchases ever given how happy it makes me and how much it has spurred my love of reading.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paperwhite is great and you should get it since the voyage and oasis really aren't worth the extra money for small differences. Get it refurbished if you can because it will be cheaper and just as good with the same warranty anyway. UPDATE: Still no problems with the refurbished!

3651,1,"I'm in love.  I purchased this for myself on Prime Day for $79.99.  My original kindle, purchased  in 2011, developed a loose/tricky onoff switch and sometimes would reboot if I rubbed it on something while reading.  I'm keeping it too, they sync together nicely.  I can read on one and the other will catch up to the correct spot with a click or swipe or two. Perfect during charging.<br /><br />I've had the device for about a week and am still getting used to the updated technology since my first one is much older.  Kind of like the difference between a dial phone and a smart phone (and I don't own a smart phone).<br /><br />I watched a You Tube video on unpacking and setting up and going over the various features.  Wonderful!  Just wonderful.  The best thing is the back light. I go to bed when my husband does but he goes to sleep and I read for several hours.  With my older kindle, I had to attach a book light and I burned through a lot of Dollar Tree cheap batteries that way.  Smooth sailing now!",5,2018-07-25,,True,,Perfection!,,

3657,1,Loved it,5,2018-07-25,,True,,That you can read in any light,,
3658,1,"I had earlier bought a basic kindle which didn't have the brightness control feature. I thought I might just be fine without the brightness control feature. Kindle is a great device to read books if you like to have a feeling of just reading from paper books not digitally. I personally never liked reading through tablets, laptops or phones. I always preferred books and this gives you the exact same feeling of a book.<br /><br />The basic Kindle is just as same as this paperwhite except for this brightness control feature. The basic one is lighter in weight and that too noticeable difference, the body of the Kindle is more like a silicon touch. The best part is, you charge it once for few hours and the battery will run a very long time like weeks.<br /><br />Below are some interesting feature it has-<br /><br />Higher resolution display (300 ppi)<br />Built-in adjustable light - read day and night<br />No screen glare, even in bright sunlight, unlike tablets<br />A single battery charge lasts weeks<br />Audible - Yes ‚Äì when paired with Bluetooth-enabled speakers or headphones.<br />Storage 4 GB<br />6.3&#34; x 4.5&#34; x 0.36&#34; (160 x 115 x 9.1 mm) Perfect Size and easy can be held in hand.<br /><br />Unlike back-lit tablets that shine in your eyes, Kindle guides light toward the surface of the display with its built-in front light so you can read comfortably for hours without eyestrain. Adjustable text size for your convenience. You can any word or highlight a section to instantly translate it into other languages. It even has parental control feature to make sure your little ones are safe readers.<br /><br />This is a nice combination of both worlds (digital and paper) together.  It really looks just like a printed page. So you get the experience of reading a physical paper book, but with the perks of being digital. The e ink display is awesome.<br /><br />Reading in bed -<br />It is a dream come true with this. I have read my Kindle at night and it doesn't seem to have any ill effects on my sleep. If anything, reading a Kindle on a low light setting (5 or 6) is less disruptive than a bedside lamp. Not to mention that if you feel sleepy while reading, it's much simpler to switch off a Kindle and slide it under your pillow than reach over and turn a light off.<br /><br />You‚Äôll see even more of an improvement with nighttime reading and this is where e-readers really show their dominance over tablets. The gentle backlight doesn‚Äôt cause any eye strain, even when you‚Äôre using one of the lower brightness settings, and it is even usable in direct sunlight. If you‚Äôve ever tried sitting in the park during the summer with a tablet, you‚Äôll know it rarely turns out well.<br /><br />So I don't think it should affect you much. It's primarily blue light that wakes you up as it tricks your brain into thinking it's daylight. If you have it on a lower light setting it would probably help though :)<br /><br />Other things to consider -<br /><br />While we‚Äôve got into the rhythm of charging our phones every night and our tablets every couple of days, e-readers have famously measured their battery life in terms of months rather than days. You can happily leave it a few weeks, come back to it and your battery will be pretty much the same.<br /><br />Do you need to buy books in kindle??? A very famous question-<br /><br />Kindle is just a storage device and a nice interface to give you a comfortable reading, buying a Kindle doesn't mean you have access to free books. It gives you a storage to buy/download books and read it in. Just like when you buy a laptop, it doesn't come up with all the softwares you need but it gives you a platform to install your SW. Kinlde gives you the same platform for books. However, there are verious public libarary to download your books from free.<br /><br />Where do I go to buy Kindle books?<br /><br />Once again, the Kindle store has you covered. You'll find Kindle newspapers, magazines, and blogs there too. Once you've placed the order for a Kindle reader or Fire tablet you can choose books and they'll be loaded and ready when your device is delivered to your door! Of course, you can add books anytime after you have your reader.<br /><br />Where do I find free Kindle books?<br /><br />You'll find free ebooks listed in the Kindle bookstore with the bestsellers for each category<br /><br />Overall, I would so don't think much and BUY it!",5,2018-07-25,,True,,"Reading made hell lot easier, yeah!!!!",,

It's great, sleek and runs smoothly like any kindle product.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I took away 2 stars because it has a tendency to die, even with the wifi off and screen brightness on the lowest setting, within two weeks, if that. My previous kindle lasted a month easily. Even if I haven't touched it, many times I will go to read it only to find that it is dead, again.

3715,1,I like how light weight the kindle white is. I used an Amazon Fire and loved the way I could read it horizontally. The kindle white does not do this. I did buy a case that lets me stand it upright without holding it. Glad I found the case on Amazon.com. I like the AmazonFire‚Äôs displaying books on the carousel and when done reading a book you just removed it from the carousel.

However, after a few days, I hardly notice it now. I was also expecting a hard plastic shell and I'm actually disappointed with the soft touch materials. I really hope it‚Äôs not the same type of soft touch material I‚Äôve experienced with various remotes that have turned to a gooey mess after a few years like my Harmony remote and Belkin 7 port USB 2.0 hub. I bumped up my review because I spoke to a coworker who has used his paperwhite for quite a while and hasn't noted any problems with the soft touch texture so it appears my concerns may be for naught.

Would not have been able to read without my Kindle.  I still get amazed I have fifty books on it and it never gets bigger.  The only downfall is when books have maps or photos or charts, you are never sure if you are going to get them on a Kindle.  I have resolved that by looking at bookstores for the book and taking a photo of the said photos, map or chart if in fact the Kindle version does not have it.  Otherwise I am a true believer.

They would not repair it OR replace it, and then had the audacity to offer me a discount code on buying a new version of their faulty product.  This seriously has me rethinking my universally positive opinion of Amazon-- I've even decided to cancel my Prime subscription in response, due to the terrible and unapologetic customer service I received.

3768,1,"I have always been the kind of person that loves books, like actual books; I love the smell and feel of a real book, as well as the joy of turning a page. My fiance is the same way and didn't like the idea of an e-reader, but even now he's kind of jealous after seeing how convenient it really is.<br /><br />When I got my first kindle, it did not include back-lighting. It seemed pretty much the same to a real book, except not as bulky. Last Christmas, my mom got me a new kindle (since my old one had worn out) and it included the back-lighting.<br /><br />Let me be the first to tell you the back-lighting is one of the best things ever. I like to read before bed, but I hate to keep my fiance up. With the kindle, I can read well into the night without bothering him because the back-lighting can be turned down so low. I've quadrupled the number of books I've read this year because of that one thing.<br /><br />The back-lighting is by far my favourite feature, but I've also moved a few times now and I can tell you, moving books SUCKS. They're heavy, they're bulky, and they don't fit in boxes well because they're all different sizes. I've got about 30 books on my kindle and it doesn't even weigh a pound. Another benefit are the prices; most of the time, you can save a few bucks as the kindle book is cheaper. I've also tried the kindle unlimited club and if you read fast, you have an endless supply of books at your disposal for ~$10 a month; that's less than the normal price for a hardback.<br /><br />Honestly, real books are always nice but when it comes down to reading, you want convenience - the kindle is just that.",5,2018-10-11,,True,,I've Fully Converted to Kindle,,
3769,1,Great for reading!,5,2018-10-11,,True,,Five Stars,,
3770,1,"I bought the Kindle Paperwhite in black as an impulse purchase on Prime Day and totally fell in love with it. Prior to buying the Paperwhite, I was reading on the Kindle app on my iPhone 6. While the app was convenient for reading during my commute, the screen was too small and I wasn't encouraged to read at other points throughout the day. After buying the Paperwhite, I'm now reading far more often that I have before.<br /><br />The Paperwhite is the perfect size and weight for holding and for carrying around in my bag. I used to hate bringing physical books with me when I'm out and about because they are so heavy and inconvenient to pull out on the bus or trolley. With my Paperwhite, I can easily turn it on and start reading anywhere. I also love that I can increase the font size which makes it easy for me to read on my commute to work without pulling out my reading glasses too.<br /><br />I bought the device with Special Offers with the intention of paying the extra $20 to remove them eventually, but honestly they don't ever bother me. I have never received a Special Offer for any product other than an ebook or Kindle accessory. The book ads seem to be tailored to my wish list and interests. While the ads are not as visually appealing as the non-Special Offers screensavers, I'm never looking at my Kindle unless I'm reading on it anyways so it doesn't matter. I don't have a case  but I do have a felt sleeve that I put it in to protect the screen while it's in my bag. I was hesitant after reading a review that said the Kindle gets smudged and greasy very quickly without a case. However, if your hands are clean you won't have any problems. Anytime I have accidentally gotten a fingerprint on the casing it has wiped off easily with a lens cleaning cloth.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend the Kindle Paperwhite if you like reading at home or on the go.  I've read more books in the three months since I bought  my Paperwhite than I did in the entire year prior to purchasing it because of how fun and convenient it is to use. I love highlighting passages and even get annoyed now when I'm reading on another platform that doesn't allow me to click on a word to view the definition and Wikipedia entry. I use it at least 4x per week and have only charged it twice in three months. It's a great product and I'm happy that I took a chance on it!",5,2018-10-11,,True,,Loved it more than expected,,

It is somewhat cumbersome to read and really get the most out of sewing and craft type books that have much needed illustration in them, which are my favorite types of books. Patterns are not easy to follow when pages are broken up. My eyesight is poor and I have to set the font pretty large, which makes it even harder for my preferred genre.<br />For regular novels or books without illustration, I love it.

I was charging it using my computer USB and when it was charged I dragged the icon to the trash to make sure to unplug it correctly. I got an error message on my Kindle that it had not been unplugged correctly and then it froze up on me. No problem, I would just do a soft reset. Well, 7 attempts and a phone call later I need to turn it in for another one. The problem now is that I am in another country and won't be back to the US until the summer. You'd think I could just process through an Amazon in the country I am in.... nope, think again. Each Amazon is like it's own little nation state with Pope Jeff Bezos at the helm. I am going to have to process the return in the US. For all the billions Amazon makes, off us little people, you'd think there would be some way to streamline unique processing of returns like mine.

3793,1,"The battery in our old kindle died so the Paper White replaced it.<br /><br />Pros: screen is much better and the lighting comes in handy.<br /><br />Cons: prefer the original page turn buttons over the touch screen but by far the largest disappointment is that collections don't transfer automatically from old to new kindle.  We have hundreds of books already and this is a problem.  Tech support gave us three different answers on how to use the Cloud to manage collections, but none of them work.  So as it stands now, we have a pile of hundreds of books that we have to manually sort and reassign on the device itself.  Not good.<br /><br />My husband has thousands of bookmarks that he hopes to retain, but as his kindle hasn't died yet, he won't find out till it gets replaced.<br /><br />I'm disappointed Amazon doesn't understand or admit that their Cloud feature doesn't work on Paper White.",3,2018-03-11,,True,,Cloud collections don't work on Paper White,,

When I called the help desk,  the connection was so choppy & filled with static, I had to hang up & call again.  I could barely hear what they were saying.  On top of that, the reps speak such broken English & kept repeating themselves as though reading from a script.  I finally figured out they were telling me to send the old Kindle back (which I did) & they would send a NEW device since my old Kindle was still under warranty.<br /><br />Looked at my account today & find out they're sending me a REFURBISHED Kindle with no warranty attached to it.  Called help desk (again with the static & broken English) & they basically said tough luck, that's the way it is.  Funny.....when the hedge trimmers I bought at Home Depot several years ago failed within the warranty period, I took the trimmers & my receipt back to the store & was handed a brand new hedge trimmer, still in the box, with a full 1-year warranty.

3877,1,"This is my second kindle, I had a 2nd generation one, but then the battery wouldn't hold a charge anymore, so it was time to upgrade.<br /><br />When I got the box, I was shocked how small it was, even more so when I got the kindle out.  The gen 2 kindle, had a qwerty keyboard and some other buttons on it that this one doesn't have.<br /><br />I bought the wi-fi only kindle with the advertisements still on it, and I didn't get the USB plug to save a bit of coin.  I found I no-longer needed the 3G/4G data (had it on my gen 2) as I no longer travel abroad, and usually there is wi-fi wherever I go, or close by.  The USB plug isn't required if you have a computer to plug your kindle into.  I've read the reviews about the USB plug not coming with the kindle and figured I would give it a shot before spending an extra $20 if I didn't need to.  So far, so good.  My new kindle did come with a USB cord, although I have several for other devices, it was nice to have another one, just in case.  The advertisements aren't bothersome at all, most are for books in the kindle library.  I tend to overlook most of them, however, there have been a few that I thought looked interesting, so I added them to my wishlist for future reading.<br /><br />Compared to my gen 2 kindle, I really like the new one.  It's small, lightweight, feels good in my hand without a case, and the backlights are nice when I want to read in bed at night and my partner wants to sleep.  The touchscreen is a nice feature, although the response time is a little sluggish compared to that of a newer smartphone or tablet.  Sometimes typing in passwords or email addresses when going through the set-up is a pain because you hit a button you didn't realize you had, or, you make a mistake and don't recognize it at first, so you have to go back and fix it.<br /><br />Since I'd already owned an older model, I didn't read the owner's manual on the new one.  At first, I thought you could only tap on the right side of the screen to advance the page, but then I found out you can hold the kindle with your left hand and swipe to the left to advance the pages which is nice.  I like that it seamlessly interfaces with social media for sharing quotes and notes, goodreads is a neat feature, and I really love the dictionary/wikipedia/translator features while reading.<br /> This version allows you to save every word that you look up in the dictionary, so you can increase your word-power.  I'm a word-nerd, and if you are too, you'll really like that feature.  Also, I really like the time to finish this chapter feature, so I know if I can sneak in another quick chapter, or if I should hang it up because the next chapter is going to take awhile to finish.  You also have the ability to personalize this a bit, you can choose, time to the end of the book, page number, or location within the book.  The percentage of where you are in the book displays in the lower right hand corner for you, and you can choose to put the clock on the page you're reading or not.  The charge holds great (it's brand-new, it had better); I've charged it fully twice so far, and each charge lasts about a week at a time.  I keep the brightness at about halfway.<br /><br />It comes with a 30 day subscription to kindle unlimited, which isn't really unlimited like you'd think.  I'm trying it out, but I'm not sold on it yet.  You can only download 10 books at a time, and you have to return one before you can get another.<br /> Not every book in the kindle library falls under the category of kindle unlimited; there are several titles that I wanted to get, but you have to pay for them a la carte, it was a bit of a let-down.<br /><br />Overall, i'm very pleased with my purchase.  I'll update this as I continue to use it and figure out what's hot and what's not.  Thanks for a great update to an already great product.",5,2018-09-14,,True,,"Second kindle I've owned, and loving it!",,

I read and read and took it everywhere. a few years later I bought a second DX in case  DX #1 went kaput and I was afraid I might not be able to get another DX. Just to be sure I would always have a Kindle. It was excellent, but it was just a little too big to carry it while travelling, So I bought the 6 inch version. It was good, but too small for me. So I bought the 7 Inch version and it was good but still a little small compared to de DX version. So I bought the 8 Inch fire version., EXCELLENT. It was easy to carry and had a good reading space, if you know what I mean. So I bought another 8 inch version just in case something happened to my first 8 incher. I have bought over 1220 books since August or 2010. Have read about 1000 of them and still have the balance to read. And I will buy new ones if they merit it. the 8 Fire is the most accommodating kindle I have. Big enough to read easy and small enough to carry it everywhere. I quit playing golf cause it was taking time away from reading. thats how a fanatical reader I am. So many extraordinary book are there. I keep track I  my computer fie of every book I have, when it was read and how good it was. My file is like 80 pages long.  The best book Ive ever read: ""The Count of Montecristo"". A story of love and vengeance. Its the longest book Ive ever read 3 times: . two in English and 1 in Spanish. 1500+pages  In Law Books: Try Dennis Carstens and Wm. Bernhardt. Excellent authors All their books- and I mean All of them are Excellent. The DX is tops, but the 8 Fire is a little more accommodating to a living Mummy widower like me, just cause its easier to carry anywhere. Enjoy.",2,2018-09-14,,,,The difference between all modles of Kindles,,

3881,1,"I've been a huge fan of e books for a while, usually reading on my tablet or my phone. I thought why bother with a kindly since my tablet can do that and more. I happen to see the Paperwhite on sale on prime day and figured I'd give it a shot. I was wrong with my assumptions.<br /><br />The Kindle Paperwhite doesn't just let you read your e-books, it goes above an beyond to make it as close to reading a real book, while having all the perks of technology.<br /><br />Visually the text is Rich and inviting. The backlights give a soft glow and are unobtrusive. Having the Kindle is nicer ,imo, than having to adjust the book because of pages.<br /><br />My favorite part is that if I come a cross a word that is new I can just look it up then and their. The vocabulary feature is nice for anyone looking to increase their words so they sound word better smart :P<br /><br />Recommendations: to get the full functionalality of your kindke, download eBooks through Amazon vs loading third party ones. Third party books will work but you won't be able to use features like x-ray or sharing, both of which are nice!",5,2018-07-22,,True,,A whole library without the fire hazard...,,

I still enjoy reading with my paperwhite because I can read in daylight and at night without having to find shade or turn a light on.  The Kindle holds a battery charge longer than the Fire of Ipad.  I wish I could read a good book and immediately share with a friend or family member without having to set up a household account.  Maybe a limit of 1 share a month.  It seems too complicated right now to share.  I probably need to read the new guide but I was anxious to begin reading.,4,2018-07-26,,True,,Kindles are the best thing since sliced bread.,,

When I'm ready to go to sleep I don't need to get up and down to turn lights off anymore. I also camp often in the spring and summer and I'm really looking forward to being able to read at night. Kindle is also very easy to use and has lots of great features. I especially like that I'm able to link my goodreads account and I can check ebooks out through my local libraries overdrive network. I am one who enjoys the feel of a book but I really appreciate being able to save space in my home and my suitcases when traveling. Very happy with my kindle and highly recommend it.",5,2018-11-29,,True,,It's a YES!,,
3912,1,"I bought this Kindle with the hopes of substituting it for paper books, especially when traveling, etc. When it arrived, I was surprised to see how slow it was. The reaction time to my fingerprint was comical. I'd click on something and the page would take a good 3-5 seconds to load and figure itself out. The screen had tons of bleeding in the corners, and there wasn't really a benefit to having this Kindle. Please don't let these botched up reviews guide you into buying this... it's a piece of junk. I went and bought an iPad instead and at least it reacts to my fingerprint instantly. The kindle also projected an advertisement while the screen was off, 24/7... Which is highly annoying considering I wanted to turn it OFF for a reason. And there are zero free books for Prime users, don't let them fool you into buying it. Cheap, terrible, dumb books with 1-star reviews are for free and the rest, you have to succumb to the pressure and buy.<br /><br />I really went into this with an optimistic look. I was excited. And now, once getting it, I returned it within an hour. Paying $80 for a black and white screen that can't load anything and has bleed through issues on Day 1, isn't worth the price at all. I'd expect this to be an Early 2000's product, nothing close to a near 2020's technology. Really disappointed. And the advertisements dupe you into thinking it's ""state of the art""... LIES! This thing is for a grandmother who is scared of technology, AT BEST! Avoid this product at all costs. I'm so glad I returned it.",1,2018-11-29,,True,,In 2018?,,

She didn't like tablets because of the lighting, and lack of book &#34;feel&#34;. This is all she uses now (except her phone in a pinch).<br /><br />I would buy one for myself too, but can't get past the &#34;special offers&#34; scam. That just means ADVERTISING! If I buy a product, I shouldn't have to deal with advertising on it. Of course, I could spend another $20 to have something removed that I shouldn't have to look at in the first place.  Until then, I will just continue to use my tablet with multiple reading apps.",3,2018-04-09,2.0,,,"""Special Offers"" are ADVERTISEMENTS! Absurd.",,
3979,1,"Very happy with this e-reader. I finally upgraded after years with my Nook Simple Touch. I got this because I do a lot of night reading and this is perfect for that. As someone that general hates ads and finds ways to avoid them at all costs, I generally find the ads to be unabtrusive. They never appear at inappropriate times that would interrupt my reading and while I typically find them irelavent to my taste, occasionally an ad or two catches my eye about something I might have missed like the recent sci-fi sale. The light also has a wide range from barely noticeable to as blinding as the sun, so for reference I typically keep mine around 6-9 to read comfortably and it goes all the way up to 20. The tablet itself is lightweight and I can carry it around in my pajama pockets around the house. Since I typically read at night and for long hours I find the battery life goes faster than expected, but such is the nature of having a backlit e-ink device. I can generally get two or three days of nonstop reading out of it with the backlight on so that‚Äôs really not so bad. I do wish that this device supported the ePub format as it would make my life a bit easier, but that‚Äôs just a minor blimish with an easy workaround. Overall this is a great affordable device that I think would be perfect for any night time readers.",5,2018-04-09,,,,Very happy with this e-reader,,

3986,1,"This device would be really nice, if some designer idiot had not decided to remove the capability for data transfer via the USB power cord that even my 5 year old phone can do.  Same USB cord works to charge both devices, but only the 3G phone can share data with the PC!  As they say in the military, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""<br /><br />The paperwhite device itself is nice, and makes for good reading, but the Inexplicable and Inexcusable removal of the simple ability to transfer data via the USB cable prevented me from using this device in the privacy of my home.  Note that nowhere I could find, was this lack made clear prior to purchase.<br /><br />Also, an Amazon customer support agent told me that the paperwhite had a built in 3G capability, and that once I had registered my device by going to a wifi hotspot, the device would automatically default to 3G if no wifi was available, and this also turned out not to be true!<br /><br />So, if you don't have/want/use wifi internet access in your home, don't buy this device unless you plan to make use of it outside your home, and don't be surprised when the device doesn't offer data transfering via the USB cord.<br /><br />If the USB data functionality were to be (re)enabled, then even in my hardwired home networking environment, this device would work well as a portable, handheld library of hundreds of books.  Without that, I have to take it outside the home to be able to shop/download content, and since I can do all of that from the safety and comfort of my home via my PC, why be forced to do this?",1,2018-11-02,,True,,USB cable data transfer disabled between computer and paperwhite!,,

3993,1,"The Paperwhite is nice and small easy to slip into most bags, thin with great battery life. I charge it once every week or week and a half and even then the battery is only half empty at most. The E-Ink display makes it easy to read at night with little to no eye strain and it's just as easy to read off of it during the day when the sun is out. The small size makes it easy to hold one hand, though the bezels in portrait orientation are a bit narrow for one handed use.<br /><br />The downsides are more of nitpicks than serious cons for me.<br />The back of the Paperwhite picks up fingerprints quite easily and they show up quite easily, ended up ordering a case to deal with that. The Paperwhite charges via micro USB and not USB-C which may be a bit annoying for those trying to stick to fewer types of cables for their devices. And finally the storage is 4GB with no other options or expandability other than moving to a higher end Kindle, granted 4GB holds many eBooks but at the same time I feel like 8GB should have been the minimum amount of storage for something in 2018.<br /><br />All in all a good eReader for reading in most lighting conditions, though more hardcore readers may want to consider the Oasis, especially for one handed reading and dedicated buttons for turning the pages and adaptive lighting.",5,2018-08-06,,True,,E-Ink display easy to read in the dark or during the day outdoors.,,

There are some paper backs I want to read and for $8-15 its not worth it but when theyre on sale on the paper white they're $1/2 and thats definitely worth it. Overall great E-reader.

I've never been a really big ""reader"" (I generally listen to my books on Audible) but I'd recently gotten into the habit of enjoying the experience of actually falling into a story with the voice in my own head.  I had been using an old 7"" full color tablet for my reading and it worked well for a while.  However, I accidentally shattered the screen when I dropped my computer on it while on vacation.  So I figured I'd reward myself by purchasing an ""official"" E-reader.  I went back and forth for quite a while debating on whether to get the entry level Kindle or the Paperwhite.  I opted for the latter and I honestly couldn't be happier!  I love the overall feel of this unit in the hand and it is CERTAINLY a different reading experience on an official e-reader (e-ink) vs. an LCD/LED tablet screen.

4145,1,"Update 8/26/18: Not long after posting my original review, I received an email from Amazon Customer support.  Only, it wasn't really support for me, it was a defense of the Paperwhite. Evidently, my expectations of an e-reader were too high. I am so sad at how vastly UNDERwhelmed I am by this product. I am far more impressed with the case I bought. Sad. So, the new PW they sent does all the same nonsense as the first with the lovely addition of randomly turning on with a yellowish (sepia-looking) screen that is very difficult to read. The solution is to push the button and put the device in sleep mode and then wake it again. One always appreciates interruptions in the reading experience. Not. The reading experience is rubbish with this device. I'm keeping it because of the anti-glare, the backlighting, and I bought it on Prime Day, so I didn't pay the premium price.  Of course, what I did pay is far more than the device is actually worth. What disturbs me, is that I keep getting emails to answer questions about my &#34;refurbished&#34; PW. Huh? I didn't buy a refurbished. Nowhere in the process was anything mentioned about a refurbished device, and when they sent the replacement, I emphasized that I bough and paid for a new device, and I expected a new device as a replacement. I was told that I would indeed receive a new one (yes, I have the transcript of that chat session as proof). So, why the questions about a refurbished device?<br /><br />Original Review:<br />Seriously? How can a device that has one purpose for existence be so bad at that purpose? I've used Kindle apps on various phones and tablets and the reading experience has always been smooth. Turning a page was virtually unnoticeable. I love reading on my iPad mini, but I camp a lot and wanted to be able to read outside and not fight the glare--plus, the battery drains quickly on the mini. So, on Prime Day, I took advantage of the Paperwhite's lower price. I was so excited to get it. Love that it is no glare. But turning pages? What a joke! Every time I turn a page it pixelates in a &#34;fly out&#34; left sort of Powerpoint transition move. I turned on the page refresh to see if that made a difference, but it made it worse. I turned that off. I rebooted the device, and still...the ungainly page turn. It's so weird, a very brief pause and then the pixelation and finally the new page settles into place.  This all happens fairly quickly, but it's so noticeable. Can I download the Kindle App on the Paperwhite? LOL  The App is so much smoother.<br /><br />I called Amazon about the issue and they said there's something defective with the device. Fine, they sent another. About 15 minutes ago, I set it up. I downloaded my books. I turned a page...and, are you ready for it?...it pixelated!  Hey, Kindle Paperwhite,  Atari called and wants its pixels back. Evidently, this device with one purpose can't match the App.  I've tried using the lightest of touches to turn pages, and that does help, but really? One-handed reading (one of the PW's advertising enticements) isn't conducive to light touches. I will probably keep it against my better judgment, but save it only for camping trips when I'm reading outside.<br /><br />The battery on this is a huge plus. It definitely doesn't last weeks, but then I read a lot more than 30 minutes a day. In the summer it's more like 3 hours a day (sometimes more).  But even with that heavy reading, the battery still lasted a full week. That level of reading on my iPad Mini 4 will get me a day and a half before I have to charge. So, the battery life on the Paperwhite is excellent.  It's for that and the anti-glare that I'm giving it 2.5 stars rather than zero.<br /><br />It is lightweight, but once you add a protective case, that's no longer relevant. I did find a case I'm completely in love with and wish they made for iPad Mini 4. If only I loved the Paperwhite as much as I appreciate the case. Alas, earwax.<br /><br />Finally, the ads. They're on the lock screen. One ad every time the screen goes to sleep. BFD. I never even notice the ads. I look for the unlock screen arrow and swipe. Maybe because it's black and white, nothing really catches my attention. I noticed them on my old Kindle Fire, and actually bought a few books that popped up, and a KF case. The ads are a non-issue for me. Pixelation on the other hand...big issue. Ugh!<br /><br />Other people seem to be having a great experience with this device (or maybe they grew up with Atari and they just expect pixelation). What are the odds that I managed to receive two defective devices within a month or is this Amazon's new version of &#34;quality&#34;?",2,2018-08-14,,True,,Pixelation issues,,
4146,1,"I upgraded during a prime sale to this from a standard, entry level, kindle. I love the back lighting and that the size is the same that I can read it with one hand. A great device if you get it with a discount. Not sure it is worth it if it is full price and you have a basic kindle.",5,2018-08-14,,True,,Loved it more than I thought I would,,
4147,1,"A lovely reading device but I really expected it to last a bit longer than this.  I just received this paperwhite kindle April 18, 2018 and here it is August 14 four months later and I already have two pinpoint light holes in the screen.  At first I thought it was a fragment of glitter or something on the screen but it's actually a flaw in the lighting of the screen. The second light hole appeared a week after the first.  Since I  don't wish to go through the kind of hassle reported by other people who have had this problem (man I should have listened to them) just to receive a refurbished replacement for my almost new kindle with the same if not a worse condition I'll just keep using this one as long as possible.  So far the light holes are annoying but not totally read destroying, at least not until more develop.  The paperwhite is not a new gizmo, they should have worked out this kind of flaw in the design by now.  I guess it just goes to show that e-readers are now disposable and easily replaced. I still have a few old style kindle keyboards that I use as well as two Fires, and they work fine. The point is that I keep multiple reading devices on hand because I can't do without my reading fix, and I do not expect them to not malfunction on occasion.  However an occasional lockup and reboot is a normal malfunction, while a screen that only lasts 4 months is a design flaw.<br /><br />8/15/18 update - I have raised the rating from two to three stars for prompt customer service, as they called and emailed me the very next day after I posted my review.<br /><br />Since I know my review was read, I will take this opportunity to express a dear wish. I do wish they would bring back the old kindle keyboard even without the keyboard buttons.  Maybe as a special limited edition for a vintage replica? A lot of us would gladly pay the voyager price or more for our old combined e-reader that had actual turn page buttons on both sides rather than the screen so you could seamlessly read onehanded even switching hands without losing the thread of the story and also had the old text to speech so you could seamlessly listen to whatever odd story or document you were reading when a task requires both hands. Reading is often not a sit down exercise but a desperately needed escape squeezed into a work break when you are juggling a coffee cup and opening doors to get to a break location that will take half your break to get there and back to the work station. Witness the walking phone users everywhere you go, it takes two hands to read on phones but the old onehanded kindle keyboard had them beat.<br /><br />If that is impossible or just too expensive to implement, couldn't the current touch screens have a few options for onehanded accessibility? It is very difficult to read touch screens without using both hands unless sitting down, and when the right hand is out of commission it is distracting having to reach across the page on a touch screen to turn it with the left hand. Perhaps that could be addressed in settings, with a simplified reading option that would turn off some of the fancier touch functions such as highlighting, definitions, etc to instead allow a touch at the middle edge on either side of the screen to turn the page and a touch on lower edge of either side of the screen to turn the page back? That would make one handed reading a real possibility with the current touch screens. We baby boomers are aging and arthritis will cause many of us dexterity issues as it stiffens our hands.<br /><br />8/20/18 second update - still in the fourth month (plus 2 days) of owning this new kindle paperwhite and I now have five pinpoint light holes. Annoying, rather like reading a paperback with smudgy print. You can still read the story but every little while the eye catches on the flaw and breaks the thread of the story. Research of Amazon's forum shows people occasionally reporting this flaw as a pixel size hole in the light screen since 2013. Too bad, otherwise this is a nice gizmo. I guess next time I'll try the basic Kindle without back lighting.<br /><br />10/2/18 third update - annoying pinpoint light holes and all, I still love my Kindles, from my aging Kindle Keyboards through my Fires and my pixelated Paperwhite. As an aging reading addict who used to dread the hopefully far off day when I would find myself in an assisted living home where I'd already read everything on the premises, they can have my Kindle when they pry it out of my cold dead hands. Given the hours a day I spend reading they'll probably have to, I'll probably go out mid-story.<br /><br />1/20/2019 fourth update. Now the collections feature frequently refuses to recognize books added by sideloading, which is the only way to load books purchased from publishers who are now out of business (such as Elora's Cave and All Romance Ebooks) or downloaded from Gutenberg onto a new device. This severely reduces the usefulness of the device, and feels disturbingly close to a move towards censoring any non-Amazon archive publications from our devices.<br />This is not a problem specific to Paperwhite as reading the Kindle forum shows many other experienced owners of various types of Kindles are having similar problems with collections whether sideloading by cable or wifi or simply downloading from their Amazon archive.<br />Imagine your school library with no card catalog or dewey decimal system, just the books shoved willy-nilly on the shelves all mixed together with no attempt to sort fiction from nonfiction or separate comedy from horror or adult from children's books. Then turn a bunch of the books inward so the spines showing the title and author are concealed with only the edges of the pages showing so you can't tell what the book might be. That's what it feels like when the collections either don't work or only show some of the books that are downloaded on the device and in the collection. This is a severe step backwards. Fix it. Fix it now.  Something this basic should never be allowed to fail.",2,2018-08-14,,True,,pinpoint light holes - design flaw in the screen. Also collections trouble.,,

4165,1,"I am restricting this review to a particular annoyance associated with this otherwise 4/5 star device. Firmware is as of July, 2018, so current as of this writing.<br /><br />I enjoy reading and have found the excellent ink technology incorporated in the PW Kindle to be a godsend for my eyes. This was in large part the reason I purchased it.<br /><br />Originally I was focused on reading novels to relax but over time took an interest in educational materials, e.g., foreign language study, and other areas which require consistent use of the Kindle's search function. It was at this point I really noticed its major weakness with respect to searching for phrases. I will break it into a few parts:<br /><br />1. The search/index function ignores many common words. For example, words such as [and, for, the, of, to, he, she, they, that, as] and I'm sure many others that I have yet to come across. These words can be important to refining phrases<br /><br />2. The search function gives no option for an exact/restrictive search so querying ""run"" will give results that include ""running"", ""gerund"", ""trundle"", etc.<br /><br />3. The results page does not rank results but returns them in order of occurrence (page) so, going by the above, if one seeks ""run"" but ""trundle"", ""gerund"" and ""running"" occur before it, those will be the first hits.<br /><br />In the context of reading novels, I rarely encounter any challenges given the limited way I use search. However, in self-study scenarios the three points above can conspire to make searches in large volumes difficult.<br /><br />As an example let's continue with ""run"" and assume someone is studying a foreign language book. S/he wishes to look up the infinitive: ""To run"". What will be returned will be a listing which ignores ""To"" (so the exact phrase will not be searched for) and show all occurrences of ""gerund"", ""running"", etc. In the case of a large volume ""To run"" may not show up until one goes through pages of results.<br /><br />Things get a bit better in the case of a phrase containing multiple indexed words; however, even here, limitations 2 and 3 apply. Further, the results ranking will also include occurrences where multiple indexed words are contained in the same paragraph, it does not restrict to same phrase.<br /><br />I realize that many will consider this an edge case and that is good, as the PW Kindle is a wonderful device for the majority of readers. If you intend to use it as more of a researching tool I would proceed more cautiously.<br /><br />As a final note I will add that the iOS (can't speak to Android) version has a vastly superior search function. If research is what you wish to do and you already own an iPad I would suggest using the free app for its superiority in this regard.<br /><br />Given the excellent display technology which we pay for with a Kindle I remain disappointed in Amazon for not updating their firmware to address an issue which may force some to turn away from the very benefit which justified the original purchase.",3,2018-09-22,,True,,Inferior phrase search may frustrate some readers,,
4166,1,"I have been a book holdout and have thumbed my nose at the Kindle for many years...Until now! I was headed out to my lanai with my Chromebook to peruse the various newspaper sites from across the country that I frequent when I asked myself the question, ""Why are you not reading a book in these instances any longer?'. The answer was....the light. At 51 and dependent on ""readers"" I realized that I was going to my Chromebook to read news sites because it was easy to see. It was like the heavens opened up and I went directly to Amazon researched the selection of Kindles. I ordered the Paperwhite and the rest is a love story!! This is on brilliant device. It's obvious that so much careful engineering went into the tactile experience when using it. It's really ingenious!

4179,1,"I have had my Kindle Keyboard for six years, and though it still works perfectly and I've taken very good care of it and still read with it very often, I know someday it'll stop working.  So for a while I had been meaning to buy a new Kindle.  I chose the Paperwhite mainly because my old Kindle's case came with the reading light function, and while I don't use it very much anymore, I still wanted the reading light option to be available to me in the future.  So I bought this while it was on a good sale along with a Fintie case for it.  So far I've started to really love this kindle, it took some getting used to, but a lot of the features this kindle has have definitely won me over.  It's much easier to navigate books to get to a certain part of them, with this one you can actually select what chapter you want instead of just putting in a random number.  And even though I loved pushing real buttons on the Keyboard, the touch screen on this is very easy to use.  The reading light is awesome, I like to read with it at about half power, but I have used it as a handy flashlight when I just need to see where the light switch is when it's at full brightness, and it will light up the room pretty well.<br />Overall while I love my Kindle Keyboard, this is a nice upgrade that I love more and more each day, and I'm glad I got it.",5,2018-06-25,,True,,Several great features made it worth the upgrade.,,

4186,1,"I adored my old Kindle Paperwhite, but after several years, a cracked screen and slower reaction time I took advantage of the 2018 Prime Day sale & trade-in promos.<br />My first kindle was so screwed up I was sent a new one after spending 2 hours with tech support because I couldn't send my Amazon purchased books thru Contents & Devices to the Kindle no matter what we tried (let alone my own .mobi files.) The second is no better, stopped working after sending 40 books and I had to manually queue all 500+ books and docs directly from my Kindle. I also had to delete and re-download over 200 books whose covers didn't download. New books don't automatically download. The device does NOT automatically connect to saved wi-fi and sync for new content like my old Kindle.<br />In the 2 weeks of owning the second replacement, I have restarted this piece of junk and also deregistered and reregistered it no less than a dozen times - the 200 books I redownloaded to get the cover images to show? All those covers disappeared again. When I restart or deregister the device, all of my downloaded collections are removed from the device. The books are still there but I have to switch from 'downloaded' to 'all' and click on all of my collections to 'add to downloaded' again. My contents and devices Amazon page, only impacts library lended books if I delete them there and deregister and reregister my device where I used to just long-hold the cover image on my old kindle and be able to click 'delete'. Content & Devices view of this Kindle itself also does NOT reflect the actual Kindle contents at all.<br /><br />I seriously hate this thing. I miss my old slow kindle with its tiny screen crack.<br />I can't recommend the 5th gen firmware model to anyone who doesn't want to spend hours troubleshooting, looking for solutions online or going in circles with tech support. If I didn't own so many books thru Amazon I would 100% start looking for another e-reader device and might still be driven to do so because this is NOT how I expect Amazon to deliver on their promise of great products.",1,2018-08-12,,True,,I HATE this kindle and wish I'd never traded in my old one...,,

It was doing the same thing, but now I had to be extra careful and really pay attention where my finger hit the screen, if my finger hit a word and not a blank space, then it would go into showing the definition of the word which I had touched and not turn the page.

Right now the books are just displayed and if I want a particular book I have to search for it. I thought that since the Kindle has been out for awhile now that it would be better than it is. You would be better off buying the Fire tablet (Fire 7 is about $50.00 vs $120.00 for the Kindle Paperwhite) to use for reading. My only complaint about my Fire tablet is that Amazon did a software &#34;update&#34; and installed Alexa, which wasn't a software update, it was a program install (without my permission.

4313,1,"The first problem was the battery.  The battery started needing recharging more often shortly before the warranty wire off,  and the day after the warranty ran out it would no longer charge.  When I called the service department they went through the usual procedure to have me it shut down. Which it liked to do fairly often on its own.  I was then told i would have to buy a new one.  I have 2 kindle fires and the original kindle reader with a keyboard,  it is still going strong.  I am also unhappy with the 3G, I paid extra for this service because where we spend our summers we do not have access to wifi ,  I was unable to access the 3G.  My original kindle had no problem accessing 3G.  My paperwhite also did not have a switch of any kind to completely shut it down when not in use.  I was never sure if it was really shut down when not in use.  Really disappointed in a product that you spend nearly $200 for a product that does not last past a year.  From the many comments made by others, the battery problem is a big one and Amazon needs to fix it or be more accommodating to its customers. Really disappointed.  I do not recommend this product to anyone.",1,2018-11-08,,,,Poor product,,

I was annoyed that you have to pay to not have ads, but there was a promo to get the paperwhite with special offers that put it only $10 more than the basic kindle. Knowing I could pay later to get the ads removed, I went ahead with it. Turns out, the ads don't bother me at all. It just looks like a picture on the screen and is only there when not in use.

4376,1,"I've owned a couple of the older Kindles back to the DX and 2nd gen models.  Using them fell by the wayside back then when I got an iPad that I could read on and do a plethora of other things as well.  Fast forward a bunch of years where phones have gotten bigger, laptops smaller, and tablets don't fill a niche as much anymore.  Enter the inexpensive Kindle paperwhite which has relegated my iPad mini to the desk drawer.<br /><br />For reading, it's significantly lighter and easier to hold.  It also doesn't have the edge-to-edge glass - or any glass - that requires a wraparound case (and more weight) to avoid getting smashed.  If you put it face-down on the table?  No biggie, the screen is recessed and still won't get scratched.<br /> Big win across the board.<br /><br />As for reading, plenty of others have discussed the screen.  Graphics?  so-so.  Text?  Great.  The backlight is nice and consistent for me and works far better than the LCD of an iPad.  The page flips are *just* fast enough not to annoy me, but slower than you get on an LCD.  But because of the screen lag it makes the kindle feel sluggish when you're doing something besides flipping pages.  A battery life of 'weeks' only really applies if you don't read all that much.  However, it's still sufficient for me to finish a book or two on a long trip/flight/etc. and there's no 'battery anxiety' like you get with a smartphone.  Charging, while infrequent, is slower than I expected.  Not a big deal since, again, the battery lasts a long while even with a partial charge.<br /><br />Unlike some, I'm happier that there wasn't a charger included as it keeps the overall purchase cost down.  Maybe only by $5 but who doesn't have a bunch of spare chargers...so why spend an extra $5?  I wish they had switched to USB-C for the port though.  It's a minor gripe, but means an extra cable to carry with me.",4,2018-05-03,,True,,"Great for the price, but where's USB-C?",,

The battery dosnt last as long as promised but making a big deal about plugging the kindle for 2 hours per week is kind of nonsensical.

My only complaint is that it doesn't seem very high-tech when it comes to searching for books-- I have to be careful where I touch and there seems to be a bit of a lag in the Kindle's reaction. That said, I still think this was a great purchase and recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />**Also, unless you are SUPER picky don't bother with the ad-free Kindle. I've only had advertisements for books and even then it goes away once I swipe to open. It's honestly not a nuisance at all. I open the cover, swipe, and get to reading.

What is so frustrating is there is nothing wrong with the device, this was a bad software update and Amazon is going to do nothing about it.

It's a small enough screen to begin with, but with the covers it displays only 2-3 books at a time.  How long should I have to spend reviewing the library vs. actually reading the books? This has to be one of the worst decision Amazon has made -- and it smacks of Apple's &#34;we know best what our customers want&#34; philosophy of programming and eliminating as many personal preferences as possible.  Some of these covers have such dark backgrounds, loud graphics, and other distracting artwork that it can be difficult to quickly locate and read the title -- it's not as if there's a standard format to them.

So far I've read two really good books on it and I think what helped me enjoy them more was knowing that the PW doesn't have any other distractions...I can only read.  Yes, it helped both books were really interesting however I can get easily distracted on other devices with internet, email, etc so I like that the PW is my ""reading only"" device.  I attached a ""ring"" to the back so I could loop it on my finger and read (hold it) comfortably.

4726,1,"I'm mainly writing this because I have an assignment due at midnight and I don't want to do it. So I'm finding any somewhat productive thing to do instead.<br /><br />Last year I got a 2nd gen Kindle as a &#34;hand-me-down&#34; and I really liked it. My biggest complaint was it didn't have a back-light, but what can you expect from an almost 10 year old device? I decided when the price was right I'd buy a paperwhite.<br /><br />So I did.<br /><br />The resolution is great! It's almost surreal looking at it. I know it's not paper, but I get kinda uneasy when subconsciously my paper shifts to different text. I'm sure there are no lasting psychological side effects.<br /><br />The back-light is a little weird. In the evening it's fine, but when I'm reading in the dark, it feels too &#34;techie&#34; for me. Like it almost feels like a tablet (which is kinda the opposite of it's main selling point). I don't mind, it's just a little strange reading e-ink in the dark.<br /><br />I do like the touch screen. The older kindle I have has physical buttons, which I'm going to miss, but this one just kinda makes sense.<br /><br />Also, the user interface is much better than the other kindle. I'm still hoping for an &#34;archive&#34; feature where I can archive a book and it doesn't show up in my downloaded books (since that's what I consider my current &#34;library&#34;), but it's still on the device. I'm probably a minority here, but it'd be cool not to clutter my &#34;library&#34; with books I'm going to get around to, just not right now.<br /><br />This is an awesome device overall.

As a way to spend less time on my phone and on social media, I decided to make myself read more in my spare time. This was a bit annoying when it came to reading in bed at night without keeping my husband up and needing to always carry books with me. I'm also a pretty quick reader, so I would usually end up carrying more than 1. I decided to try the Paperwhite out after reading reviews on Amazon and Reddit, and I'm so glad I did. I've had it for just over a week and have already read 2.5 books. The size and weight are perfect and I really love that there is no glare in direct sunlight. My favorite thing, however, is that the light doesn't give me headaches the way that iPhones and iPads do.

4928,1,"At first i thought &#34;Kindle will be great when travelling, but I'll always prefer paper when I'm at home&#34;. Now I'm using Kindle whenever I can and I never really miss the feeling of holding a book in my hands. I have had the Kindle for 8 months now and it is a great product! I read more now than ever and it has even helped me find one of my favourite books so far.<br /><br />There are a bunch of functionalities that might seem redundant to the common book reader, but when you start exploring the possibilites you can get a great benefit from them. The build-in dictionaries have helped me expand my english vocabulary (I'm Norwegian) and have also helped me practice spanish. I can read spanish books now without having to refer to google translate every other sentence (and can practice glossary later since the words I have translated are stored).<br /><br />The selection of available books is obviously great and it's very easy to find new books to read that fits my preferences using goodread or simply following amazon's suggestions based on previous reads and searches (I think it is). A lot of older books are also available for free on some websites, which is exclusive to the digital format. You can also easily convert other formats, like pdf, if you want to read a research report or similar (but I haven't tried reading two-column formated papers on Kindle though).<br /><br />Battery life is great and it's small and light. I can actually carry it in my jacket pocket in winter to read on the bus. It is robust and doesn't appear cheap.<br /><br />The web browser is slow and suboptimized, but I don't see this as something negative. It would just be a distraction if it was any better. Now you'll only use it, for example, when you want to download a free book directly to your device.<br /><br />The only drawback is that the LEDs are very blue, but this is not a dealbreaker at all for me. It is better for your eyes not to read on a backlit screen, so you should use a lamp instead. The backlights are helpfull to compensate for low lights in a room, and you will only notice the blue colour if it is very dark.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to everyone who likes to read or who wants to read more but needs a little motivation.",5,2018-05-18,,True,,I enjoy reading even more with this product. Delivers on its promises and more!,,

4932,1,"I have put off buying a Kindle for a very long time, which is strange because I love technology and typically buy every new gadget that comes to market. This past week, feeling overwhelmed with my growing library of hard cover books and having to travel with a 5 pound tomb so i would have something to read on the plane, I decided to finally bite the bullet and join my girlfriend in getting a Kindle. I have 3 iPads, so a fire like hers was unnecessary, so I went with the paperwhite. I have never been more disappointed with a tech purchase.<br /><br />Everything turned on fine and was already registered to my account (a nice touch) so I quickly purchased my first book and began reading. That was the end of my positive experience with the Kindle. Immediately I was plagued with small text that required holding the Kindle too close to my face for comfort. I looked for an option to change the font size with no luck an even went to YouTube for some videos, The options to change the font size are noticeably missing. Oh well, I figured I would power through and finish the book anyway. Now 20% into my first book I am constantly encountering pages that fill only about 1/3 of the total screen size and are completely unreadable. I can zoom in on these pages to read them, but that is a hassle and significantly slows my reading speed. Every other page or so is now at the 1/3 size. Reading the same book on my iPad with the Kindle app works without issue.<br /><br />Of course, I contacted support. I have spent more than 3 hours working with them so far including updating the Kindle firmware, deleting and redownloading the book, returning and repurchasing the book, and even deregistering and reregistering it to my account. Nothing has worked. Now I am in a pattern with support where once every 24 hours or so they email new instructions which I try unsuccessfully, and then I wait 24 hours for new instructions.<br /><br />I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm a busy CTO who works about 80 hours per week with volunteering on top of that. I don‚Äôt have time to fuss with something that was supposed to make my life easier, but has instead only complicated it. My recommendation: avoid. Stick to paper books with their amazing smell and texture under your fingertips or use an iPad with the screen brightness turned way down.",1,2018-08-02,,True,,"Brand new kindle, and I hate it.
