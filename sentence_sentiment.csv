4165,1,294,"This was in large part the reason I purchased it.<br /><br />Originally I was focused on reading novels to relax but over time took an interest in educational materials, e.g., foreign language study, and other areas which require consistent use of the Kindle's search function.",0.0,0.0
4165,1,572,It was at this point I really noticed its major weakness with respect to searching for phrases.,-0.699999988079071,0.699999988079071
4165,1,668,I will break it into a few parts:<br /><br />1.,0.20000000298023224,0.20000000298023224
4165,1,716,The search/index function ignores many common words.,-0.6000000238418579,0.6000000238418579

4165,1,1133,"The results page does not rank results but returns them in order of occurrence (page) so, going by the above, if one seeks ""run"" but ""trundle"", ""gerund"" and ""running"" occur before it, those will be the first hits.<br /><br />In the context of reading novels, I rarely encounter any challenges given the limited way I use search.",-0.699999988079071,0.699999988079071
4165,1,1462,"However, in self-study scenarios the three points above can conspire to make searches in large volumes difficult.<br /><br />As an example let's continue with ""run"" and assume someone is studying a foreign language book.",0.20000000298023224,0.20000000298023224

4165,1,1892,"In the case of a large volume ""To run"" may not show up until one goes through pages of results.<br /><br />Things get a bit better in the case of a phrase containing multiple indexed words; however, even here, limitations 2 and 3 apply.",-0.5,0.5
4165,1,2129,"Further, the results ranking will also include occurrences where multiple indexed words are contained in the same paragraph, it does not restrict to same phrase.<br /><br />I realize that many will consider this an edge case and that is good, as the PW Kindle is a wonderful device for the majority of readers.",0.699999988079071,0.699999988079071
4165,1,2440,If you intend to use it as more of a researching tool I would proceed more cautiously.<br /><br />As a final note I will add that the iOS (can't speak to Android) version has a vastly superior search function.,0.20000000298023224,0.20000000298023224
4165,1,2650,If research is what you wish to do and you already own an iPad I would suggest using the free app for its superiority in this regard.<br /><br />Given the excellent display technology which we pay for with a Kindle I remain disappointed in Amazon for not updating their firmware to address an issue which may force some to turn away from the very benefit which justified the original purchase.,-0.6000000238418579,0.6000000238418579
